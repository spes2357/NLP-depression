            "[\"I want to pay off my debt then kill myself.\\nI came from a really poor family, worked hard during primary and secondary school. Got a scholarship for college which paid me 10k a year as well as covering my school fees. Gave parents the money, it paid for the bills as well as my siblings's school fees. Thought life was good, studying what i love. However, i got bullied until i cant take it anymore and requested a change of class, the school rejected my request. I then requested to take a semester off school, but the contract for the scholarship states that i have to complete school by 3 years or the contract will be terminated. Failed a module and i have to extend my time in college by a year, which caused my scholarship to be terminated. Which in turn placed me in a 30k debt. Now, i don't have money to pay for school, so i had to leave. Im out without any qualifications except for a secondary school cert, with the organisation that offered me the scholarship requesting 1k per month for installments.   \\nI've always looked forward to my dream job, i was so close, i volunteer every weekend to get experience from that job. Now it feels like everything is taken from me. I appealed to have my scholarship reinstated 3 times, explaining the issues that i had, giving them the medical reports from my doctors, bringing up the volunteer work i did. But on the latest attempt, i got a call saying that they never planned to accept my appeal. It really feels like everything is taken from me. I feel like just working to pay off my debt so as to not burden my family as the debtors will go for them if i die now. There's nothing to look forward to anymore.   \\n3 years of suffering incoming\", \"I'm not worth it\\nI just don't feel like I'm worth anyone's time or effort, and I just feel like a burden to everyone.\\n I have a part time job (anywhere between 20-39 hours a week) and I'm at college (in the UK &amp; I'm 18)and I'm constantly tired. \\nMy mum is such a lovely person, but I really do feel like she'd be better off without me, she's always complaining how she never has time to do anything (she works 30 hours a week + she always cooks + cleans up after my stepdad and brother but complains about any mess I've made)  and I'm lazy, messy and I quite often ruin her day. But I'm sure I've ruined her whole life. \\nShe had me when she was 19, which meant she had to quit her job because she couldn't afford childcare and she had an abusive step-dad, who would refuse to let her mum look after me, and she also fell out with her very religious grandparents as she wasn't married (they have since made up). She then couldn't get a job until I started school (which is actually a decent job). At this new job, she met my step-dad (after a few years) and they've since had a child together (who also doesn't seem to like me one bit). My step dad seems to hate me more than my mum does, but I can't complain because neither of them are abusive, and this is one of my problems; I feel like I shouldn't moan about anything in my life; I live in a decent sized 3 bedroom house, I have an education and I also have a job. Whilst my mum lived with her abusive step-dad, was forced to quit college (so she could get a job to start paying rent) and was also forced to baby sit whilst her parents went out drinking every other night. Yet here I am, never feeling happy, without many friends (I talk to the people at work when I'm there and I have 2 other friends that I speak to around twice a month, normally because there other friends are busy and they want to complain about their boyfriends, or because the other friend doesn't want to go  shopping on her own ( another reason why I don't have a reason to be negative; she was in care and now classified as homeless as she's now 18 and not catered for in the care system, so now she has to live in temporary accommodation with lots of drug users in the same building.)\\n\\nI feel like I just ruin everything, if I'm downstairs with my family, there always seems to be an argument, even if I'm not involved in the argument. But if everyone else is in the living room, whilst I'm upstairs in my own, I can only ever here them laughing and enjoying themselves. It's like, even when I haven't done anything, I seem to just produce a negative atmosphere.\\n\\nI really don't want to be here anymore, if I disappeared, it wouldn't really effect any one, my mum might be upset at first but she'd quickly realise how much better her life is without me.\\nThe problem is that I'm even too lazy and stupid to kill myself, so I'm just secretly hoping that a medical issue that has been ongoing for a while (and I haven't been to the doctor's in years because I would just be wasting their time, when they could be helping someone better than me) is serious, and nature will take its cause...\", 'No lodging for the sad\\nBeing depressed sucks. That\\'s easy to grasp. Most people who aren\\'t clinically depressed understand this. What they don\\'t understand is that being depressed and honestly trying to get better is extremely difficult, and our ruggedly individualistic society doesn\\'t give a single fuck about you. You need help? Fuck you.\\n\\nYour wealth isn\\'t just something you have, it\\'s seen as a reflection of your worth as a person. Poor? Sad? Find it difficult to wake up? Find it difficult to complete things? Do you procrastinate because of underlying psychological issues? Fuck you, you\\'re just lazy.\\n\\nThe clear message capitalism sends me is that if I can\\'t work, or I can\\'t work enough, or I can\\'t work doing a \"high value job\", or if I need help to get better so that I can do those \"high value jobs\", I probably ought to just go die, because I\\'m clearly worth nothing.', \"Nightmares and dreams\\nHI, I don't know about you, but when I was a kid I used to have this weird nightmares (not the teeth fell out usual nightmares) Like getting lost in a winter forest in pijamas just to be eaten up by wolves, being totally awake at my bed while insects ate me alive ( like sleep paralysis but dreaming?) or just watching my mother being eaten by feral dogs as she protected me.\\n\\nAnyway, as I grew older and my depression grew with me, I stopped having nightmares, I can barely recall when the last one was. Instead I have pretty vivid dreams (not lucid ones) and in most of them, I'm at some kind of weird scenery where I feel like I've always been there, and weird shit happens that I can remember, and it's like a full story, a lot of different things happen in the same dream. The problem is, in most of them, I meet someone, normally a girl, with which I start a mutual relationship after overcoming some hardship, like, my biggest desire. These dreams, as good as they sound, are worst than the nightmares because when I wake up, it takes some time to realize that I did not live that shit, that I'm still in bed, and I'm still alone.\", \"How do you get a job after over a year of unemployment?\\nF early 20s. I never finished college, came home, and I've been so depressed that I haven't done anything since I left school in 2016. I'm a really hard worker and I've always been liked by my bosses, but I don't feel comfortable giving references because any part time jobs I've had I kind of - just - abandoned. I would get to a point where I couldn't handle the social anxiety and depression and my job would call me to see if I wanted to come back during a break from school and I would never call back. Now I'm in this weird limbo that I don't know how to get out of because I basically don't have any credentials or references and there's a massive gap in my resume that I can't explain. \", 'Why is it so hard to just be empathetic?\\nToday, I failed miserably at baking a key lime pie. Filling was way too loose, meringue wouldn\\'t whip, crust cracked, just a terrible time overall. And then my mom comes over and instead of comforting me or something a normal human being would do, says \"Better luck next time,\" with the tone of a carny trying to get a six year old away from his ring toss booth. I got even more upset, and that seemed to genuinely confuse her.\\n\\nAll I wanted in that moment was for her to say \"I\\'m sorry your pie didn\\'t turn out, it\\'ll be okay.\" Or just something a human being with emotions would say to their upset daughter.\\n\\nThis even just kind of exemplified what I get sick of in people. Even if you don\\'t \"get it\" why is it so hard to realize that people have different priorities from you? Especially people who are depressed or have other mental illnesses. It can be a triumph for us to get out of bed some days. If we share an achievement or (more rarely) a failure with you, be with us in that emotion for a moment. Why is that so hard for \"normal\" people?\\n\\nOh yeah. Because all the empathetic people are depressed.', \"Life can go fuck itself. I think I'm done.\\nI'm a mechanical engineer graduate. I came from a different country to the United States to study engineering, hoping I can make something out of myself. I poured blood sweat and tears trying to get good grades and graduate proudly. I never went to parties, stayed away from drugs, focused on having good relationships with people and overall being kind wherever I could.\\nThis country does not want to hire me at all.. Wherever I send my applications I get rejects. This was my only dream and meant everything in life. All my friends and moved on getting jobs. I have an excellent profile and some really good work to show for but the leadership is a little unpredictable, so companies don't what to hire people like me.. I watched so many people cheat their way through exams and projects and gone to get hired by companies like Amazon and Google.\\nI have not seen my family in three years. And can barely afford to eat more than one meal a day. I'm getting recurring nightmares of being a failure and this makes me want to end it all.\\n\\nI've decided to stay in the US as long as I legally can. Then then, if I'm not getting a job..

I feel like Iâ\\x80\\x99ve accomplished all my very serious ambitions from graduating college to studying in grad school and withdrawing, twice. (I was doing fine in grad school, they were job prep program. School Psych and a teacher prep program. I withdrew basically because I was apathetic about the job goals/mission. I studied philosophy/psychology during my undergrad and I feel extremely content with all the knowledge Iâ\\x80\\x99ve accumulated, but it just feels like Iâ\\x80\\x99m getting old. It feels like friends are moving away, the world is getting smaller, less wondrous. Itâ\\x80\\x99s like realizing Iâ\\x80\\x99m too old to aspire to great things like being an astronaut or something. I feel like my role models are way too big, or that things are just downhill from here. So Iâ\\x80\\x99m asking myself questions like why bother working? Why bother moving forward? Maybe Iâ\\x80\\x99m pessimistic and think the US political situation is horrible and itâ\\x80\\x99s affecting me. But I wonder how older people without kids keep going forward. What pushes them?

This bridge has been used before. I was driving downtown and I noticed someone on the opposite side of the railing. My girlfriend was in the passenger seat and before I could say anything to her.

As soon as we ended our thing, I started running everyday, eating healthy food only, and going to the gym. 1h30min of HEAVY exercise everyday. I did this until this very day. I lost fucking 15kg (my weight at the start was 90kg, now 75kg).\\nI also bought green contact lenses to wear, and even sunbathe. I invested so much time (and money) to improve myself and look amazing and no. one. noticed.! I look at the mirror and I am happy with my results. Then, the moment I exit my house:BOOM. 4 months thrown into the trash. No one cares. It makes no difference.  The women I'm attracted still do not find me attractive. It pisses me off how I imagine they won't survive just one week of my training. They can't see how hard I worked to change.

Why people don't give a chance to know me??? \", \"I need to get my life on track\\nIm 23 year old black man who just graduated from one of the best universities in the US. I've been depressed as fuck for a large portion of the last 4-6 years. I have no money, no girlfriend(or prospects), and no social life to speak of. I had a solid social life in college but had no luck with girls. Made a lot of friends but none that I'd consider great ones. I'm  afraid of public expression, if I come out of this shell I'll just be that little underdeveloped, short loser who thinks he's the shit when he's accomplished nothing in life. I'm afraid of what other people think of me, do they think I'm smart? Do they think I'm nerdy? Do they think I can't dance? Do they think I'm too short? Do they think I'm attractive? Do they think I'm gay? Do they think my voice is deep enough? Do they think I'm laid back? Do they think I'm fake? Do they think I'm a pussy? Do they think I get girls? Do they think my dick is small? Do they think I'm dressed well? Do they think I'm shy? Do they think I'm lame for a black guy? Do they think I act too white? Do they notice the awkwardness when I talk? Do they think I speak well? Do they think I ask too many questions? This causes me to lie to the people around me, including my family about little things that it's unnecessary to lie about. To put on this front of fake confidence when inside I feel like I'm not worth shit. I blow off my friends and then justify it to myself that I'm somehow too good for them. I don't pick up phone calls from family members and try to keep to myself. I just do nothing all day and wait for shit to come to me. I'm not the guy that gets girls, when it comes to trying to actually start a relationship with a girl my awkwardness and lameness just begins to show itself and she immediately senses it and can tell I'm not shit. I've had sex with 2 girls in my life and couldn't actually bust a nut for whatever reason. I'm an asshole to the people around me that do really nice things for me but somehow my brain keeps justifying my behavior and I keep doing it. I can't bring myself to do anything that is remotely productive or will help me better my life. I'm self aware to the point where I know I'm being a complete piece of shit but I can't find the motivation to turn it around. It's like my brain telling me I'll be content just living in my parents house until I'm fucking 60 years old. Somehow when I look in the mirror I see myself as an attractive man, I just look super young for 23, people say I look as young as 16 so I'm also self conscious about that which also makes me put on this facade when I'm around people. Recently for long stretches of months I just go completely ghost and don't leave the house or do anything of use. On the bright side I've had many positive experiences in life where I've felt my potential as a person start to become realized. I have a degree in communication studies from a top 15 university in the US. I have a family that loves and supports me (but probably wants me to move out just as much as I want to move out). This is all pretty incoherent and stream of consciousness but my brain is just really jumbled right now and I had to vent. I need to turn my fuckin life around.\", 'Long text, I just want an audience.\\nWhy havenâ\\x80\\x99t I killed myself yet?\\n\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s not the title, but a question that lingers on the back of my head every second.

Itâ\\x80\\x99s not a huge problem really, its another lingering question or jealousy I have whenever I meet a person. Every single one of them have someone who cares for them, even a stranger would care for them. It makes me feel jealous that no one would care for me or even bother to be nice to me unless I open my mouth and say I have cancer or they knew about any of my situation.

', 'Writing out my feelings in hopes of gaining some sense of catharsis\\nI\\'d like to start by saying I don\\'t think I\\'m a danger to myself. I\\'m tethered here pretty strongly by my family and my best friend. I can\\'t see myself leaving them, because I\\'ve seen what it does to people when those closest to them go. I resent the fact that I can\\'t go, at times, but there\\'s nothing to be done about it really. \\n\\nMost of the people in my life only ever knew my outer shell. The somewhat false personality that I put on in order to function. Over the last three years my mask has been crumbling away and the results haven\\'t been pretty. It\\'s been a viscous feedback loop that leaves me feeling worse and worse as people fall out of my life one by one, either by their own choosing or because I distance myself to hide my pain as I become less and less able to handle it. \\n\\nThe summer after my sophomore year I was in the darkest place of my life. I had to pull out of university and move home to get therapy. It was actually very effective, and my junior year was a home run. I was getting the highest test scores in STEM classes with 600 students, I was killing it in my philanthropic efforts, and I had more friends and social obligations than I knew what to do with. \\n\\nMy senior year I spent the fall studying abroad in France. It was magical. I fell in love for the first time. I wasn\\'t reciprocated, but the thing I learned about love is that it doesn\\'t have to be reciprocated to be the most beautiful thing you\\'ve ever felt. \\n\\nWhen I got back from France, the seeds of my current ruin were planted. All throughout college I\\'d been heavily involved with a camp for kids whose parents have cancer. I did it because my dad had cancer when I was a little kid, and the people I met were all wonderful, but most of all because the only thing that gives me a sense of purpose is helping other people. It drives almost everything I do. This camp gave me a rock that I could cling to through the worst of my emotional storms. \\n\\nThe two directors of the camp were both new my senior year. While I was in France, one of them dropped out of school due to her own struggles with mental health. The director that was left over was completely overwhelmed, and entirely ineffectual. People left and right were telling me that I should take the open position. I didn\\'t want it; I have ADHD as well as depression and I was so anxious about my lack of organization. Camp was in such a hole though, and for the sake of my friends and my campers and their families I did the only thing I felt like I could do, and took on the directorship. \\n\\nIt was rough. My co-director continued to do little of anything, and I felt like I was juggling grenades. I couldn\\'t fuck this up. Kids I\\'d been mentoring for years needed this camp to cope in a healthy way, and for a number of parent couples, the week of camp was the last time they got to spend alone together before one of them would pass away from cancer. \\n\\nMy grades dropped a whole point, on average. My volunteer research suffered, and I really let down the post doc I was assisting (Sorry Bethany). My mental health took a nosedive as well.  \\n\\nI made camp happen. It was ugly and bumpy and unorganized, but I made it happen. I took solace in the fact that the kids didn\\'t seem to notice the flaws, but it didn\\'t do a lot good for my relationships with the other volunteers. \\n\\nI redoubled my efforts at the beginning of my 5th and final year of college. I moved into a house with some of the other volunteers who I was closest to. I had to quit my research, and I couldn\\'t keep my grades where I wanted them, but camp planning was progressing well, especially after our national organization took notice of the lack of effort on my co-director\\'s part and added a third director, my friend and newly minted roommate A.  \\n\\nA helped enormously, but I still had so much on my plate. To cope with the stress, my drug use started to skyrocket. I was smoking weed and cigarettes all the time, and to keep up with all my biochemistry coursework and 8-10 planning meetings a week I was taking my prescribed adderall more often than I should have been. I became thoroughly addicted. In my final quarter of school, everything really fell apart. \\n\\nI was completely overwhelmed, and became less and less effective at my job. I put A in the exact position that I had been in the previous year. I could feel him resent me more and more every day, but I was too ashamed to talk to him about it, and he never asked me how I was doing. \\n\\nI barely graduated. As soon as school was over I quit adderall cold turkey, because it had been putting me in a very dangerous mental headspace for weeks, but until then it had remained a necessity. The withdrawals hit me like a truck. Getting out of bed felt like a truly herculean task. I was an empty husk of a human being and from graduation to camp in August I contributed almost nothing to the camp. I had nothing left to give. \\n\\nA hated me by that point. He began to tell people what he thought of me, and they listened. I watched helplessly as some of my closest friends and roommates began to look down upon me, if not for what A was saying then for my severely depressed behavior. I couldn\\'t even really blame them. After camp, when we had our traditional fun awards ceremony, A was awarded \"Most likely to make camp happen by himself\". I was awarded \"Linger\", a camp song I was known for singing, but also a very pointed jab. It was humiliating. \\nAt the afterparty that night I drunkenly told A everything. He said it was ok, and I cried lying drunk on the porch.\\n\\nI lived in the house with him for a few more months while I looked for a job. A was incredibly distant, and became more and more hostile over time. I got a job on a crab boat. I had a few reasons for doing it, but the most important reason in my head was that I might be lucky enough for it to kill me. The day I moved out A sent me a 6 paragraph essay over text, detailing everything I\\'d ever done that had disappointed him, and letting me know that there was nothing I could ever do to win his respect back. \\n\\nI left the state to work on the crab boat. For 5 months I lived in isolation, either working or chain smoking weed to keep myself from ruminating on all my failures. The crab boat did almost kill me. Multiple times, in fact. In the end I quit, not because I was suddenly afraid to die, but because my captain was the most sadistic piece of human scum I\\'d ever met, and I couldn\\'t take him any more. \\n\\nI\\'ve spent the 5 months since then trying to find a job. 50+ apps out and I\\'m no closer than when I started. I\\'ve been up to visit the city I graduated in twice, but both times I\\'ve been wracked with crippling anxiety. I can tell how A affected the opinions of some of my closest friends, and it kills me. \\n\\nSo, that\\'s where I am. I\\'m going to go smoke a cigarette and pray that I get my dad\\'s cancer even younger than he did.

One item which came up that I have not thought about in a while was the specifics of my uncles suicide when I was around 13. \\n\\nMy uncle was a 28 yr old gay M, developed HIV and killed himself. Though this is not what I was initially told. It took around 10 years with every year or so getting a new piece of information. Initially I was told he had cancer and died. Then I was told he had cancer and my grandparents \"pulled the plug\". Then I was told he was gay, had cancer, and my grandparents \"pulled the plug\". Then I was told he was gay, had HIV, and my grandparents \"pulled the plug\". Then, finally, I was told he was gay, had HIV and killed himself.\\n\\nI think I secretly had an understanding of how he had killed himself even when I was a kid and was not told due to subtle hints that kids will typically pick up on. Even if I did not, I always had the feeling that something was wrong and that my parents were not truthful.\\n\\nAfter discussing his death for two hours for the study, I realized that the depression I have been feeling for over 12 years is so similar to the feeling I get when I think of my uncle. Intense grief. I delved into the feeling more and have not been able to stop crying for the past few days about my uncle. \\n\\nDoes this make sense from a psychological stand point to be greiving for this long?

I'm getting my own car here shortly.\\n\\nI recently had a really bad breakup with a woman who I had spent almost 3 years of my life with. I'm heartbroken and absolutely lost. She was my world. She told me I was her world. She has found someone else and now claims that most of what we had was fake and now she wants nothing to do with me. \\n\\nI can't find any reason to continue with life. I don't have any control over my own life. My folks don't want rent, but they control every aspect of the rest of my life instead and every time I walk in the house, I can feel the tension and I get talked to like a child whenever I don't follow their rules. The woman I had committed my life to now practically hates me. I see no way out. \\n\\nI just want it all to end. Please let it end. \", \"This is how I feel and I have a slight sense I am the only one to think think this way. I am depressed? Help wanted\\nI yearn for the days I was in high school. I felt as if I was always happy and never worried about anything. I am 22, just having graduated from University. It seems each day I am becoming a person who does not want to have a relationship with anyone other then my family. I want to be alone. Happiness to me is being sheltered by reality--alone with my thoughts. I deleted every single bit of social media I had about a year ago (SC, FB, Insta, Twitter, etc) in an attempt to become as alone as possible.\\n\\nI truly deep down wish I was never born, but I would never ever commit suicide. I wish more then anything else that I can just disappear and leave this world.\\n\\nI am studying for the MCAT currently. I don't have any problem doing so because of my extremely addictive personality, but I find that I enjoy things that take my mind off of reality. Studying, reading, listening to music or going for a drives are my favorite ways to achieve this. But the reality I see is that this world is shit. I believe that as a whole, humans are riddled with greed and selfishness that are the motivations behind MOST of everything in this world. And by humans, that obviously includes myself and I hate myself down to the core for the selfish things I have done.\\n\\nMaybe I am too cynical or something. But this bad world syndrome fucks my brain and idk. I REEEEALLLLY question every aspect of life and I can't help it. Each time I am left with questions that completely make me hate the way this world is. I guess I can give one example. The most recent self-philosophical argument I had is the idea of wars, with murdering others specifically. We praise those who fight for our country, yet at the same time a great deal of these same people are super religious. Do people not evaluate the reality they are in? Do they not question why they believe the things they do? Am I the only one? Does someone's act of ending another life provide justification for doing the same? Who is to even say so? If they would kill all of us if we did not kill them, then what makes our lives worth more? \\n\\nThat's just one example, but then I look at areas like American healthcare or the fact my family and others are wealthy while there are people fucking dying because they cannot get water or food. Even the American political system with the deep state and shit. Why are we even on this damn earth? Seriously, what is the point of everything in life? I simply don't view the joys of life being worth living for.\\n\\nI just don't understand. This whole text here is just me rambling my thoughts in hopes that someone somewhere reading this could maybe help me. \", \"I should be an actor...\\nI feel like most people who have depression could work in theatre or movies. I don't know how you guys feel about putting on an act when really you feel so sad that it's hard to breathe, but recently I have been having to act like I am getting better from depression. My roommate confided in me one day when I came back to our dorms that he struggles with depression. He was placed in a foster home after his parents died, and his foster mom committed suicide. After that, his friend also committed suicide, so of course this takes a toll on someones' emotional health. I told him that I started taking meds and going to therapy, and I smile and laugh and act like I am doing better so that he can feel encouraged to get help with his depression. I feel so fake though, even though I am getting help, I don't think it is helping me, my chest has that particular empty feeling and breathing is hard to do. I feel like crying a lot of the times now while I am laying down in bed, and driving to and from class. I would never let my roommate know that I was actually not doing better though. I really want him to get help because I see myself in him, and he is a really good person who doesn't deserve to be sad. I wish depression never existed, it is such a sick disease.\", 'Can we talk about personal hygiene, or lack of there of\\nI really canâ\\x80\\x99t even remember the last time I showered, and itâ\\x80\\x99s not even me enjoying being a nasty bitch I just  donâ\\x80\\x99t want to?

I am absolutely gutted.\\n\\nMy boyfriend has pretty serious depression and is in dire need of help. I won't be able to get him in to see a therapist until next week. He has recently become quite down on his luck and he hates himself for it. His anxiety stopped him from going to work, and he was fired. He has a new job now, but he hates it as it is a factory job where he works 60 hrs/week.\\n\\n Any time I try to help him find a new job so he can leave this job, he completely panics and shuts down and I can't say anything or else he yells. It has gotten so bad recently that I dread waking up in the morning because of the psychological warfare with him. He will do things like saying he wants to self-harm, or he is going to jump out of the car while I am driving.\\n\\nI have been with him for years, through thick and thin. I have had to bring him to the hospital before, and he did get better for a few months. He told me tonight he doesn't want me to pick him up from work, and that he wasn't going to come home. At this point I feel completely lost, and I know calling the police won't help.\\n\\nI feel trapped and I need to get out for my own health, but I am deathly terrified he is going to kill himself if I leave. He told me I am the only thing holding him back from killing himself. I'm scared. He is such a good person when he isn't feeling this constant depression. I don't know how to get him to understand we just want to help him. He shuts me down every single day, and it hurts knowing he has given up on himself. \\n\\nWhat can I do to help him until he can see his therapist next week? I want to leave but I am so scared he will kill himself if I do.\", \"I'm gonna die a virgin. No one likes me and I have no friends.\\nMy masculinity, self-esteem, and sense of self-worth have been destroyed thoroughly and are simply nonexistent anymore. I don't even bother trying anymore, I just wallow in my own sadness and escapist entertainment trying to find a reason to continue living with the fact that I'm worthless. No woman would ever be into me and I'm gonna die a virgin. I can't even find solace in masturbation because whenever I see any sort of porn I go deep into a depression again because seeing two people enjoying each other makes me envious. I have no friends and now I don't think I can make any.\\n\\nI can't make friends with people I don't know how to do anything right man.\", \"I was rejected &amp; I feel great\\nLast night I asked a close friend of mine on a date and was rejected, but strangely enough I don't feel dejected but rather proud and accomplished.\\n\\nTo provide some background, I'll be turning 20 on the 15th, and last year, just 4 days after my 19th birthday, I was diagnosed with Persistent Depressive Disorder. This disorder is characterized by long lasting, essentially uninterrupted periods of depression lasting AT LEAST 2 years, and in many cases, such as with myself, far longer. To provide a rough estimate, I have been depressed somewhere around a total of 13 years of my life.\\n\\nThe depression has had a serious negative affect on my love life, at times making me cold and even cruel. The most egregious example of this was when, after having dated this girl for a few months, I stopped talking to her almost entirely and started flirting with other girls. Eventually she had to get her friend to break up with me on her behalf because I was refusing to talk to her. At the time, because of the depression, I thought little of myself, seeing myself as a worthless scumbag, and so I started acting like one. I was also afraid to open up to some else, so instead I became emotionally cold and avoidant. I hated this behavior in myself, and held a deep guilt for how I had treated women I had been with, so about 5 years ago I stopped dating entirely.\\n\\nDespite being rejected, having finally had the confidence and self respect to ask out a woman and accept the no graciously is a major growth in my self esteem and wellbeing, so having done so I feel a great sense of accomplishment. This has really helped boost my self esteem and confidence, even though I was rejected.\\n\\nThere's no real point to this story, but I just wanted to get this out there, because I'm really proud of the progress I've made so far.\", \"Why does it seem like everyone's irritated with me all the time?\\nIt always feels like people want to get away from me. I feel like my personality make me way too annoying for people to want to be around, unless they have to in the workplace, to which they just get more and more irritated as the hours go by. This isn't just like being in a bad friend group, ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE I know has needed a break from me or told me to go away. Counselors who are getting paid to deal with me make me feel like I'm being too annoying. Maybe I'm talking over them too much or I'm too jittery. I feel like people are always trying to dominate me or shut me down.\\n\\nNo one has every seemed to seek me out or wanted to be around me. I'm the only person that enjoys my company and that's all I have. I talk to myself a lot. I make myself laugh a lot. This is occurring to me as I'm typing it and I feel like crying. I just want a person I can make laugh and inspire. I want to make a difference in someone else's life.\", \"My gf is planning on killing herself and idk what to do...\\nOk so me and her have known each other for 9 months. We are in a long-distance relationship. We have never met in real life. I think she may be bipolar. One night she told me she cut herself a little bit. On her thigh. At first I thought she was joking. She showed me the mark if lefted in the morning and I knew it was serious. She is 16 and I am 18. She has told me before she wants to die. She has had a bad past with men but I won't go into any details. It was just really bad. She doesn't talk to her parents about it just me. Her mother and father may get a divorce so that makes this situation even worse. She can be really happy at times then really down. We get in fights sometimes but they are usually resolved. She always complains she is a bad gf because she treats me like shit. I forgive her for doing so because of her shit life. Today we were just talking casually and a few mins later she said I will kms on said date. Then I told her why would u. She said love u bye. We then went back and forth until I decided to leave her alone. She said she wasn't feeling ok. But I have never heard her give me a date before. Saying you will is one thing but a date means you have planned out how u want to go. I didn't tell my parents the full story and neither has she. She has tried killing herself before. I didn't know her at the time. She doesn't have any friends in real life and the ones she does have just use her. She is also behind in school which stresses her out. I will go into more details if anyone is willing to help me and thank u for hearing me out.\", 'What are ways to connect to a close person who is depressed ?\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ve been dating a girl for 7 months and Iâ\\x80\\x99ve notice her cycle of moving close to me then pushing me away .

We never make a big ass meal together on Saturday anymore. Honestly, I don't think they'd even want to go anyway. \\n\\nThere's no one else I'd ask.

Ever since I was a kid I daydreamed of owning a mansion with fancy gates, a huge lawn, a big pool. This was always my goal. I wasn\\'t going to accept living in poverty like my parents or having an \"average\" life. So I worked hard for it. I was always top of my class, I was on the dean\\'s honor list in college, I started (and failed) my first few businesses, joined clubs, went to a lot of events to meet people, and landed an internship. I was even in the middle of starting my next business. I also got my credit score up to almost 800 and started funding my retirement/investment account.\\n\\nBecause my whole life has been focused on success, I attempted suicide a few times when I found out I was illegal and couldn\\'t even go to college in high school.

Depression is wanting to have friends but are too anxious to go out and stay a while longer. Depression is forcing yourself out of bed, not for yourself but those who count on you. Depression is having an empty feeling inside your chest while your head is crowded with self loathing. Depression is where people tell you \"it will all get better\" but only hearing the silent whispers of the wind. Depression is where you slowly lose your personality, joy, and interest for those things that you have used to love. Depression is where a stranger tells you \"I\\'ll be here for you\" and you take it as an insult.\\n\\nDepression is where you hurt, crawl on the floor crying, grabbing on to dear life alone in your dark room with your thoughts, too tired to do anything and then go to bed only to rise again to pretend that nothing happened.\\n\\nTo pretend, nothing happened. ', 'Painfully lonely and spiraling into the worst depression I\\'ve ever been in\\nI recently moved to a new city for a job after college. I have a few friends at work, but they\\'re a group of guys that I don\\'t have a lot in common with and we don\\'t really talk outside of the occasional work conversation. They\\'re nice and I\\'m happy to be friends with them, but it\\'s hard for me to really get to know them because they do \"guy stuff\" on the weekends (like sitting around drinking and playing FIFA) that I\\'m totally not interested in/they don\\'t bother inviting me to. Other than that, I have a few online friends that I\\'m growing increasingly dependent on for social interaction which is really unhealthy. I notice myself getting more paranoid with them about not responding, and I bug them way too much to the point where I know I would definitely be annoyed if I was them. Also they\\'re not very supportive (probably the opposite) but it\\'s not their fault -- they\\'re just causal online friends that shouldn\\'t have to cater to my current host of mental problems.\\n\\nI\\'m totally alone. My family and college friends live 4 hours away. I have pretty bad social anxiety and I\\'m terrified of every new social interaction I have. I work 9 hours and come home to my empty apartment and watch netflix to escape my own life, every day. I sometimes hear from my college friends about all of the fun they\\'re still having together and it honestly brings me to tears that I have such a pathetic lonely life now. I\\'ve never been able to have a \"normal\" social life -- it takes me forever to make close friends, and then even at my best I only have a handful of good friends at a time. I don\\'t enjoy going out every weekend or the other obvious ways of making friends, and that wouldn\\'t work now anyway since I would NEVER go alone and I don\\'t have a single person that I could ask to go with me. \\n\\nWhen I was a freshman in college I had this same problem -- absolutely zero friends and living in a totally different city. It was the worst depression I\\'ve ever been through. I had dozens and dozens of online friends at the time (now we\\'ve all lost touch and moved on from the RPG we were playing) that helped ease the loneliness, and I eventually joined a student club and finally made friends after like a year of going. There\\'s not really anything I can \"join\" like that in a non-college town... I\\'ve been applying for a few volunteering things, they haven\\'t started but I\\'m doubtful that it will be a good way to meet people. \\n\\nI honestly just need ONE person to talk to. Anyone. I don\\'t know what\\'s wrong with me, I\\'m not a complete weirdo or anything and I know I can have meaningful friendships (just 90% of them have been online, and now I can\\'t even seem to make any fucking online friends either), but I live the loneliest life of anyone I\\'ve ever known or heard of. I\\'ve never been serious about suicide, but recently that\\'s changed and it\\'s becoming something I could actually picture myself doing. I\\'m a long way from that but at this point I don\\'t see anything getting better and I practically cry myself to sleep some days and have to hide emotional breakdowns at work after eating lunch alone. \\n\\nDoes anyone have any advice for meeting new people in a non-college town? Anyone else having the same problem? I\\'m so lost and sad and pathetic', \"Has your family always ignored your problem?\\nI think the hardest part of being depressed since I was a kid is how absolutely ignored I was/am by my family. My parents split up when I was 5 and my father died when I was 10. My family completely sweeped it under the rug like I was supposed to be completely ok with it and it has never been a topic of discussion at home. I walked around sad, slumbered over, quiet, avoided eye contact and stared into the distance for years and years and no one ever assumed proper to ask if there is something wrong with me. The only time they sent a psychologist my way was when they had to determine who I should live with after divorce. My mother to this day seems absolutely oblivious to my suffering.\\n\\nI don't ever feel like telling them for they will propably assume I'm ungrateful and spoilt. I've had everything! They sent me to school, fed me, put clothes on my back. What else could I possibly need?\\n\\nI don't want to burden or blame anyone for what has happened but just I feel so abandoned.\", \"Embarrassing myself at volleyball tryouts\\nI'm a freshman in high school and we just did volleyball tryouts and they were fucking horrible. I had to wake up at 5:30 to go to them because they started at 6. Literally everyone there was better than me. I fucking hate everything. I'm such a failure. Like everyone was doing actual spikes and sets and shit and I was just there. They probably thought I was in special ed. At least if I had a mental disability I would have an excuse to be so shit at volleyball. I'm probably gonna quit tbh. I've never wanted to die more in my life. And I know you're probably gonna say do your best and I am but my best isn't good enough. This is what I get for trying to be less depressed using a sport. I don't even look like I'm in high school,I'm just a short 5'0 Indian kid\", \"Alienating family\\nDo you ever get tired of saying you're okay when you're not but you don't want to talk about it? So instead you just stop talking to them but then you feel worse for alienating your family and they have no idea why or what's going on with you. \\n\\nMy family has never been super close. We get along with each other and talk to each other but we're not a support system and I don't feel comfortable talking to them about my problems. I feel like I'll be judged and gossiped about so I just keep it to myself and as a result wind up pushing them all away. \\n\\nThe only person in this world I feel I can talk to about my problems are my husband and I know that's a huge burden on him to be my only outlet, my only friend. It's putting a strain on our relationship and I blame myself for this. It's a lot of pressure to put on someone. Living with a person with depression is hard enough under normal circumstances (whatever normal is) but add the burden of being the only friend, the only person that knows, the only person period. Eventually that only person is going to get tired of it.\", 'Reminder that it will get better.\\nEveryday I get home from my part time job, I cry for at least half an hour before I get up to go inside and finish the rest of my day.\\n\\nEveryday I feel and believe that things just keep getting heavier to deal with. That my life will not become healthier and I wonâ\\x80\\x99t ever be happy. Itâ\\x80\\x99s one issues after the next, or all at once and I keep wanting (sometimes do) push it off to the side.\\n\\nEveryday I also remind myself that it will get better. Sitting here alone, sobbing my eyes out while texting this post, I donâ\\x80\\x99t believe it in these moments, but Iâ\\x80\\x99m not giving myself any other choice/exception. I will beat this and be happy.\\n\\nDepression and anxiety and all that jazz can suck the fun out of life in seconds. I want to remind you all that even when you really donâ\\x80\\x99t believe it, keep telling yourself youâ\\x80\\x99ll be happy and healthy. I want all of you to, you deserve that at least.', \"Constant battle between ambition and not wanting to live.\\nSince I was about 12 I've had recurring suicidal thoughts. The thing is, I don't have low self esteem or anything of that sort, it's actually quite the opposite and I always joke about being a narcissist. I may not be an actual narcissist, but I've always had a slight superiority complex.  I don't hate myself, but I just hate my life and the continuous chore known as living. On the outside, I've always been the life of the party, but deep down I don't ever remember being happy. As someone who's highly ambitious, it feels as if there's a never ending struggle between wanting to be successful enough to be well known or have an impact on the world, and wanting to stop existing. Yet with the prospect of the latter, comes the failure of the former. I know that if I lowered my expectations in life I would be mildly happier, yet the thought of settling for mediocrity gives me horrible anxiety and fills me with dread. \\n\\nRecently things have gotten worse due to my university workload. I've been having trouble completing assignment and functioning in general. I've considered getting help but I feel deeply uncomfortable at the thought of opening up to someone, since I'm not a very emotional person. I've come to accept that I will probably never be happy. I've always wondered if I would be more likely to actually commit suicide if I ever attained the level of success I desire since I would have then achieved my goal in life, or if that would finally bring me the contentment I seek. I suppose it would be the former since I can never be content. \", 'Still recovering from ex-girlfriend\\nTo preface this, Iâ\\x80\\x99m sure anyone who reads this has seen something similar on this sub a million times already. This is long and the last three paragraphs are my main point, the rest is just an explanation of my previous relationship.\\n\\nA little over a year ago my ex and I finally split after a long year and a half of on and offs filled with tons of emotional abuse. It was mainly her abusing me at first, getting angry for not texting her quickly enough, coming at my neck for hanging out with friends everynight ( I assume was because she stayed home all the time) and so on. The last couple times we dated she was always angry with me for cheating (which I never did) later to find out she was the one cheating on me. I was extremely depressed once we finally cut ties that I went back and talked to her and then she told me she cheated in detail so she could bring me down more.\\n\\nAfter the breakup I ended up getting sick and after a couple months couldnâ\\x80\\x99t even bring myself to take care of myself. Small stuff like wearing my retainer and showering before 5pm was the hardest part of my day. I know that seems small but it plays into how I feel now.\\n\\n3 months after the breakup I started talking to a friend I met through my ex (however they were not and still arenâ\\x80\\x99t friends anymore) and weâ\\x80\\x99ve been happily together for almost a year now. There was a lot of useless drama with my ex about this which has been resolved but she still tries to harass me and my girlfriend. Last month she texted my phone from her friends number trying to harass me and it was just ridiculous. \\n\\nUnfortunately I have to see her in May for my girlfriendâ\\x80\\x99s prom, they are in the same senior class and I an currently a college sophomore. I still feel as though I am in a rough place and donâ\\x80\\x99t physically look as good as I should. Stuff such as my teeth and acne and other results of that loss of hygeine that I still struggle with makes me feel like I have been doing worse than her, which I know shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t matter but it still bothers me. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve tried getting my old habits back which work for a month and then I lose track again.\\n\\nI guess my overall issue is I compare myself how I was when with her to where I am now, mostly with my appearance. Iâ\\x80\\x99m also still very depressed and feel that it puts me below her now. My only real win is that Iâ\\x80\\x99ve nearly kicked my drug addiction (mainly weed, I was using it to runaway from my problems) but now I canâ\\x80\\x99t seem too kick my other habits of nicotine addiction and taking any kind of pill or cough syrup just to not be sober. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve distanced myself from friends and I simply feel lost and useless to the world. In college I canâ\\x80\\x99t make new friends and just sit in my dorm room wishing I could go back and start over so I could be healthier than I am now.\\n\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m looking for advice or anyone to be straightforward with me on any aspect of my situation. Thank you to anyone who reads this and responds!\\n', 'I think I ruined another friendship\\nTL;DR: Made a wonderful friend, had a depressive episode, and ruined the friendship by trying to force my problems on her. Just like I\\'ve done a million time before.\\n\\nI\\'ve had depression my whole life and I\\'ve always gone through episodes. Sometimes they\\'re mild, and I\\'m just generally down for a few days, sometimes they debilitating and I can barely get out of bed for weeks. I\\'ve also never had a lot of friends. I don\\'t have casual relationships. I either don\\'t really think of you a friend, or I love you with every part of my heart. There\\'s no middle ground.\\n\\nI\\'ve been building a friendship with a great girl from work (call her Amy) for a few months. It doesn\\'t seem like anything romantic is gonna come from it, but it was nice to have a friend I could do stuff with. We went hiking, rock climbing, we even went on a scuba trip to the Caribbean together. I\\'d opened up to her about my depression and she seemed really understanding. She actually seemed to appreciate how open and communicative I was about it.\\n\\nThe day before the Super Bowl, I felt an episode coming on. It wasn\\'t severe, but it made me fragile. I\\'m a big Patriots fan, so when the Pats lost, it set me up for a bad episode. If I\\'d just been sad about the Patriots Monday and let myself heal like I usually do when my teams lose, everything would have been fine, but instead I started to blow my friendship.\\n\\nI texted Amy Tuesday that I was feeling down and I\\'d like to see her. I made a big deal about how I wasn\\'t crying about the Pats, but I was having an episode. It seemed important to me to point that out for some reason. She said someone was visiting from our India office and had a ton of work for her, but she would try to come over after. She worked until 930 that night and never made it.\\n\\nWednesday I left work at 10am because I was too down to stay. I was texting her the same stuff throughout the day, how I was sad and I wanted to see her. She worked until 930 again and didn\\'t come, but this time she had never promised to. I texted her this big apology about how I\\'ve been a shitty friend and I\\'m sorry for forcing my problems on her. At work Thursday she told me to stop apologizing for everything. I told her I would try to stop.\\n\\nFriday just felt different. She was less talkative with me than usual. She brought me cookies she made, and I thought that might be a sign that things were getting better, but after work I asked her if she had plans that weekend, and her answer was simply \"yes\". I said have fun and left. Normally she would have at least told me she a general idea of what she was doing.\\n\\nI talked to my roommate/best friend (Samantha) about it Friday night. We agreed I needed to just leave Amy alone for the weekend, so I texted her and said if she found any free time I\\'d love to see her and then I didn\\'t contact her again until yesterday at work.\\n\\nYesterday some things happened that really made me feel like things were ending. First, we had talked about planning a trip President\\'s day weekend, but she had a surgery and she didn\\'t want to plan anything until it was done (that\\'s a whole other thing that\\'s bothering me). When I asked her yesterday, she said she thought President\\'s day was in March and she promised to see her brother this weekend, so \"we\\'ll see\". She also told me she likes working late and going to the gym at like 930. Apparently she\\'s been working 12 hour days for the past week. The gym part hurt because one of my favorite things to do with her was work out, and now I\\'ve lost my gym buddy.\\n\\nI\\'ve had a lot of friendships go this way in the past. Speaking a little immodestly here, but when I\\'m not depressed, I\\'m funny, energetic, and interesting, and generally a fun person to be around. I\\'ve had lots of people enter my life, meet that me, like him, then after a few months meet the depressed side of me and just nope the fuck out. \\n\\nAmy first met the depressed me a few months ago and she didn\\'t run away. I thought she could be a big part of my support network moving forward. But I\\'m worried that I just tried to put too much on her. Like I\\'ve done a million times before.\\n\\nThe worst part is she sits right next to me at work. She\\'s leaving next month to hike the Appalachian Trail, but until then, if I really did blow this, then I have to sit next to her every day for a month. I don\\'t know if I can handle that.\\n\\nAnyway, thanks for listening to me whine about my problems.', 'Just venting\\nNot sure the general gist of where this post is going but I just kind of want to write down my thoughts. I tend to feel better after I do so. Maybe along with that I can have the added bonus of affecting somebody else in a positive way with what I say or that someone else understands what I\\'m saying. \\n\\nI\\'m alone as I type this. I\\'m sure many people who frequent this sub would describe themselves in that way. I feel over the years I\\'ve been getting more and more depressed. I was depressed when in my teens then I hit a lull in my 20s where I just didn\\'t care about much and put things out of mind. Now, I seem to be at a combination of both. A kind of dead, feel nothing type of feeling mixed in with depression. I\\'ve been getting angrier as well. Bitter and resentful. I feel like when I was a teen I just thought strongly that I wasn\\'t very great in the general sense. I feel like I now know that to be true. After enough life experience and enough time with yourself you start to see who and what you are. \\n\\nNeedless to say I don\\'t like who I am. Maybe you don\\'t either. I\\'m not as strong, wise, caring, compassionate, friendly, hard-working, courageous, generous, et fuckin cetera that I\\'d like. \"Well, why don\\'t you change?\"  Cause I clearly don\\'t fuckin want to. \\n\\nMaybe I enjoy being depressed? Because obviously I\\'ve laid out terms, so to speak, for me to be depressed. Not courageous, hard enough working, kind etc etc. Yet, I don\\'t do shit about it. So why complain as if I\\'m depressed because of it? I think that\\'s where the day to day numb feeling comes in. It\\'s like \"I am this way. I don\\'t like being this way. I don\\'t change being this way. Why tf are you even upset?\" \\n\\nI really don\\'t feel I deserve what I have in my life. Like the organ donor program I feel I\\'d want to give my body to someone else. Maybe they can make better use of my fully functional legs. My vision. Ever see those people do an absolute fuck ton of things with their life? Those people who are so driven to accomplish a b c d e f g... Every day of their life and they only have 1 limb? Are blind? Live in abject poverty?  I have NONE of these fucking hurdles. I, in fact, don\\'t have anything anyone would legitimately call a hurdle in life and yet I feel depressed. \\n\\nIt\\'s probably justified that I feel this way. I don\\'t do anything to try and feel better and I don\\'t capitalize on advantages I have in my life to make things better. To grow as a person. I don\\'t do that for myself let alone for other people. And yet I want to have success.. I want to have profound love. Meaning and purpose. What a joke\\nJust wish I could hit the fast forward button on this shit and get through with it. Oh right.. There\\'s suicide. But even that holds it\\'s own unique stigma to it. Next to no one would recommend you do that. It\\'s not an ideal solution. So on and so forth. But you kind of have to admit that those that do go through with it... It\\'s as if you can\\'t question them. You can\\'t question their pain. Can\\'t question their sense of guilt or anguish or depression and sadness. They solidified it and made it real moreso than practically anyone could ever do when alive. \\n\\nSometimes I wonder if those that commit suicide do so because it\\'s either a) the only perceived way out of their grief or b) that it effectively proves to others beyond a shadow of a doubt what kind of hell they had been living through in the years leading up to doing it.\\n\\nYou can never question someone who killed themselves as to whether their pain was real. Not just in the sense that they\\'re no longer around to ask but that no one would ask what everyone inherently knows. Of course they felt pain. I feel that might be suicides greatest allure. It effectively puts a stamp on your sadness as legitimate.\\n\\nI\\'ve thought about it a lot throughout my life. I don\\'t think I\\'d ever have the stones to do it. Maybe my life or state of mind just isn\\'t that bad. Not yet anyways. \\n\\nKind of a long read :/   Hi to all those that like reading long posts from internet randoms ð\\x9f\\x91\\x8b ', 'I used to know exactly what I wanted to do in life, but now when I look foreword all I see is eventual suicide.\\nMy whole life Iâ\\x80\\x99ve wanted to go enroll in Animal Studies at NYU to eventually get a degree in zoology.

Itâ\\x80\\x99s just been awful. Anyways, when I try to look foreword once again that my young, stupid self had planned out when she was little, all I can see is... nothing. I just want to be clear that the only reason Iâ\\x80\\x99m still on this earth is that I know suicide would crush my family. I want help, I really do, but my pride wonâ\\x80\\x99t let me ask. And even though I (temporarily) decided to live, the call of the peace after death still calls out to me.

Sometimes I get a burst of motivation and try to do something but I give up really easily.

I still shower, eat, go to work, even the gym sometimes.\\nI'm not really close with my family, I rarely talk to them and its only when they talk to me and I'm okay with that since I don't really feel like I want to or could hold a conversation with them.

I have a girlfriend and I cling to her so hard because I'm so happy when I'm with her and when I'm not with her I'm always thinking of her and get sad that I'm not with her. She recently told me that the way I think of relationships is immature and she cant offer that much time to me since she has other friends who need her too and get mad at her for not soending enough time with them. I can't let go of the way I think relatiomships should be and I want her to reciprocate even if I know it's irrational and I don't feel like anything else in life is really worth living for. I'm not suicidal though, there's a few times it crossed my mind but I always think about how I wouldn't really ever do it or start regretting it while thinking about it because what if things do get better?

Too late I just backspaced two whole sentences! There is this big fucking hard block of concrete in my head that stops me from doing anything including things I like such as drawing and reading.

I\\'m just so sad and disappointed in my life and how I\\'ve done nothing with it. Even as a little kid I never did anything fun and I don\\'t have any wild stories of adventure, excitement, nor things like \"Lol we were dumb kids yada yada...We did this all the time yada yada...\" I\\'m sorry for the rant.

Where im at, at the moment feels like the worst its ever been, I keep having full blown melt downs about how much I repulse myself. Throughout my life Ive been on more diets than I can count and tried multiple different excercise routines. About 4 years ago I gained 30kgs really fast and after moping and feeling sorry for myself i decided i would kick it up a notch and started taking things really serious. 6 days a week at the gym, personal training, strict meal plans - the works. This worked so well at the beginning, I dropped 18kgs in the first few months. It came to a halt and for the past 3 years I've continued to lose weight slower - im at about 25 kilos down in total now. I thought I would be further along by now.\\n\\n I live and work on the road at the moment travelling from town to town so ive dropped the gym membership but I try and make up for it with doing workout sessions on my own, lots of hiking and swimming. I recently switched to a keto diet from the previous meal plan I was on. I am fitter than I have ever been and what I can achieve now in a physical capacity is so much greater than ever before in my life (I was less fit even as a child) \\nThe problem I have is that im still so overweight, I very rarely find anything that fits me in stores and i dont have an address to order things online. I feel like people could look at me and assume I dont give a fuck about my health when I do and that makes me feel worse. Anytime I talk to doctors about unrelated issues they make it about my weight. I feel like outwardly im the worst version of myself, I look in the mirror and get angry. Does anyone have any tips on how to pull myself out of this? I feel so crushed when I'm reminded of my weight because I dont feel how I look. I want to be proud of my achievements but I'm not, I feel annoyed that its not better and I havent reached a bigger goal. I think ill never reach a weight I'm happy with - which is not only devastating to me but bothers me so much more because im genuinely trying my hardest. Ive had hiccups and times where I've literally tried to eat my feelings away but I always pick myself up and try again. I dont know how many more times I can fail.\\n\\n In an effort to help me stay on track my partner started eating the same foods as me. Weightloss had never been his goal or something he was focusing on, it was just to make it easier on me not to see him eating a toasted cheese sandwich while I was eating salad with no dressing. He wanted to limit the temptation and helped cook me awesome healthy meals that tasted a million times better than anything I cooked. For him it worked a treat, he was never overweight just a bit stocky, but hes since lost so much weight and looks amazing. And whilst im so happy for him it hurts as it just shows how much progress i havent made. As stupid as it sounds I think it highlights my weight more when we're together cause he looks so fit and healthy and I look like I sit around eating kfc all day. I want to be confident or at least more confident but I'm so critical on myself I cant even begin to let the confidence through. Any thoughts on this are appreciated and thankyou to anyone who took the time to read this.\", \"Post graduation depression is real.\\nIt's been 5 months after graduating from college and I've never been depressed more than ever. Unemployed and feeling worthless. Parents are forcing me to get a job already, Peers landed their dream jobs / found a job that pays well and earning more money than me. The feeling of being worthless is overwhelming. Crushing. While unemployed, I've finished a free short course on graphic design and got my certification after passing the assessment and currently doing one on web development. I want to learn more skills in order to land a good job. But I don't think my parents would understand, as they want me to get a job already, any job (Customer Service Representative jobs are a trend in our country which most of fresh graduates end up, I'm not detesting that kind of job but it ain't my thing). I'm depressed more than ever. Fucking anxiety. I've been avoiding my  peers because I don't want them to see me unemployed and broke. I'm anxious because I don't think I'm worth it and anxiety had been a problem for years. I'm depressed because of the pressure my parents are giving me. I'm mad because nobody understands me. I'm sad because I don't have anybody. I'm afraid because I might end up a loser in the end.  I'm a mess because of the all of the above.  (God. I sound like a whiny bitch on my first post here on this subreddit.) Anybody else feeling like me? What/Should I do?\", \"I know you shouldn't need someone else to complete you but...\\nI feel so alone and empty and the few times I've ever felt truly happy is when I'm with a guy, whether he's using me or not. Idk it's led to me getting my heartbroken a bunch, I let so many guys use me too but I guess in a weird way I was also using them? I was never really in love with any of them except for 1 and was mostly in it because I loved the idea of a relationship. I don't like being alone and I fear I'll never find someone I truly love and who loves me, leading to me living my life full of sadness and regret\", \"I have gone days without talking to anyone\\nI just got out of a bad relationship recently. But I have a issue with dependancy. I let him dictate my entire life. I let him into my head to the point I feel brainwashed. I hate everyone. I don't trust anyone. I don't want to talk to anyone because I know he will get mad and be jealous. He is the closest and only person I have in my life and even though we broke up he wants us to remain best friends. We dated for 2 years and it was Rocky the entire time. But I let him get his hooks into me and I can't get out. I am terrified to not have him in my life because then I will be truly alone. I don't talk to anyone else. I am 26 years old and I have 0 friends other then him. I am terrified of being alone. But he is seeing someone else now. She is 100 times better then me in every way. She is super model gorgeous and everything that me and him shared she has as well. I feel replaced. But I don't want to not be his friend and not have him in my life. I'm terrified to lose him. I cling to the hope one day he will want me again. I haven't talked to another person in over a week. and if he is busy with her I don't talk to anyone at all. I just lay on my couch staring at the wall and having a constant never ending panic attack. I have sever depression and severe anxiety that I take medicine for both. But they only make the feelings bearable and don't take them away completely. I don't sleep. I just want to throw myself at every fuck boy on dating apps just to have some kind of physical attention even if it is only sex. Even if I am not attracted to them. I don't care. I just want someone to love me. I want someone to hold me and make me feel not alone. I don't know what to do. I feel like I've been kicked in the chest. It hurts to breathe. I made a noose and stood on a stool with it around my neck for over a hour the other night crying. But I couldn't do it. I don't know how to go on living. \", '\"i had nothing to offer anyone except my own confusion\" Omegle chat with stranger about life\\nYou\\'re now chatting with a random stranger.

I will start with a time table.\\n\\nWe began dating after meeting on a popular dating app and we hit it off fast. Similar interest, goals, outlooks, expectations, and lifestyle.

I contacted her and we had long winded email correspondence with in which she had this quote to me \" I feel lost at work, lost in my personal life, and just lost with trying to find my happiness. You do make me happier. And idk what just snapped last week but I was super depressed all week .\"\\n\\nI talked with her and we set small goals to rekindle and help her find her happiness. We got back together with in two weeks and that started a prolonged honeymoon period for which we traveled, went on ski trips, took our dogs on hikes, and generally enjoyed ourselves.\\n\\nThis continued until march or 2018, when I noticed her slipping back in to her just overall never satisfied state. I got worried and tried to lightly push her to no avail. I then tried to make plans at least twice a month to help distract her and give her a solid thing to look forward to. She never changed and just got worse to the point where the last 2 months, she gets home from work smokes enough weed to put me to sleep, eats too much and then goes to sleep by 9. I tried to encourage by proxy by going to the gym and going to parks with her dog and taking pictures and even getting closer with her family. nothing worked.\\n\\nFast forward to 2 weeks ago, she went to Sweden on a vacation with her best friend and had a blast and was calling me everyday so happy and excited. I thought we had a legitimate break through. Then one week before she returns i start to only get 1 or 2 text a day, I figure she is living her best life to busy with international travel to communicate regularly like she requested.\\n\\nShe returns and we spend one night together and she calls me at school to come over to her place asap. she dumps me with little to no explanation.

I've been in-and-out of various states of mild to severe depression throughout my teens &amp; twenties, but I've always figured this is just something everyone has to deal with at some stage or another, so I've never sought help even when falling off a proverbial cliff edge. After much deliberation, someone I care deeply about got me to try counselling, but I find that I'm really not getting much out of it right now, as I don't have the will to try, and my focus is all over the place (I'm being tested for ADHD too, but I'm still awaiting the results). My Doctor suggested trying a combination of antidepressants and CBT (the latter of which I am currently attempting to source a support group for), however I have an underlying phobia of long-term medication after seeing several people close to me, use it as a crutch and just become something wholly unfamiliar to me as a result. I've been prescribed Citalopram (Celexa for those stateside) but like I said - I have deep-seated reservations about taking them and before I tried, I wanted to see if there was anywhere/anyone I could talk to about their experiences on the drug and any perhaps any suggestions they could offer about managing short-term (6-9 months) antidepressant medication? I've looked at the sub-reddit rules for this group and I'm not sure if this crosses rule 3; if so, can someone help me find the right place to ask my question(s)?\", \"Doing things that I like reminds me why I don't enjoy doing them anymore.\\nPlaying your favorite game?

Everybody is passionate about something right? I'm not. I don't ever remember the last time in my life I was genuinely excited about anything. What makes everything worse is that in 1 month, I have to decide what I'm going to do with my life. Here in India, we don't get to pick our classes individually. In junior and senior year, you pick what stream you want (Commerce, Humanities, Medical or Engineering). The first two bore the hell out of me. I'd like to do Medical but I don't think I can study for another ~10 years after high school. I'm good at the Engineering subjects (Physics, Chemistry and Math) and I like CS but I've never really enjoyed doing it. Don't get me wrong, I'm not bad at studying. I'm among the top kids at my school. Everybody thinks I have my life figured out and somehow that just makes it worse. I'm fucking terrified of what the future holds. I stay up whole nights crying just going over what is going to happen and trying to achieve some sort of clarity about what I'm going to do. I have tons of friends at school but I've never connected with anyone. There was this one guy I was really good friends with and had a crush on since 6th grade but he changed schools last year and we lost touch.

Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been going since high school and over the years have had depressive thoughts, suicidal ideation, lack of motivation and interest, high anxiety, numbness, hopelessness, etc etc. recently itâ\\x80\\x99s been coming back.\\n\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ve been on Zoloft which made me feel like a numb zombie and bupropion which I didnâ\\x80\\x99t feel was working. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve also tried Xanax (made me calmer but high) and a mood stabilizer that didnâ\\x80\\x99t really help. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve since gotten off medication by my own choice but the problems are coming back. Generally I donâ\\x80\\x99t like rx drugs and would rather do it naturally but itâ\\x80\\x99s not going away.\\n\\nMy question to people is what antidepressants have worked, how long have u been using them, and has ur depression improved? Should I take it for the long term? And what alternative methods have worked for you guys?', 'My Story - There is hope.\\n**TRIGGER WARNING - includes graphic language.**\\n\\nHi there, first time posting. I see a lot of posts from high school/college aged people, and being through that myself, all I want to do is reach out and hug them and tell them how special they are. Instead of writing all the typical stuff \"you\\'re so young,\" \"you\\'ll grow out of it,\" \"go see a therapist/take medication,\" etc., I thought I\\'d share how depression affected me mentally &amp; emotionally and my journey through college. I got to the point where depression was life threatening, and I had given up all hope. I was lucky because my mom (and my dad) were 100% committed to my recovery, even if it meant I deeply hated and resented them at the time. I realize not everyone has that, but in sharing my story, I hope that maybe certain aspects can resonate with people going through the same thing I did and help them not feel so alone.\\n\\n**How Depression Affected Me**\\\\- trigger warning\\n\\nIt finds a way to connect to memories. To healthy feelings. And twist them into something dark. It craves uncertainty and pain and tells you that you deserve only that. It makes you seek out the deepest crevices of your mind and get lost. To the point where you donâ\\x80\\x99t even know whatâ\\x80\\x99s you and whatâ\\x80\\x99s the sickness anymore. It almost feels good to indulge because itâ\\x80\\x99s so familiar. Weâ\\x80\\x99re taught that enduring pain is somehow one of the most beautiful things a person can do. But what if that pain isnâ\\x80\\x99t real?\\n\\nIn college, I was so afraid of being alone that I wouldn\\'t want guys to leave my room. And there were a fair amount of them. I\\'d beg them to stay longer and tell them I had separation anxiety. As long as I was focusing on them, I didn\\'t have to focus on me. I justified it by saying that I was \\'enjoying\\' my college experience and \\'exploring\\' my sexuality. \\n\\nI thought it was normal to not see color, to not ever be excited, to want to drink until my body was as numb as my mind. I wondered how other people could live life with relative stability and thought I was weak for not knowing what they knew. To me, it seemed like common knowledge that life was pointless and ultimately a waste of time. I didn\\'t understand why I was the only one that couldn\\'t cope with that fact. When I was home over a break, I told my mom that I had accepted I would never be happy. When my mom said she was hurt by that, it didn\\'t even occur to me why. I thought I had learned the secret that everyone else knew, the secret that let them go to class or work or see friends or make friends.\\n\\nEven though by the end of my freshman year, I was cutting myself and promiscuous and drank with the purpose of blacking out so I could have even just an hour of relief from myself, I couldn\\'t admit that I had depression. I thought I felt and acted like that because I was lazy, stupid, slutty, weak. Every semester, my grades slipped a little (or a lot) at a time, and my parents grew more and more disappointed in me. I had been a star student in elementary school, frequently getting the highest scores in class and got into every top middle &amp; high school. I felt like such a failure. At this point, my parents sent me to a very expensive therapist, which ultimately was a waste of money because all I did was bend the truth to hide every aspect of myself and life. I don\\'t think I could have even been honest even if I wanted to at this point.\\n\\nThe first semester of my junior year, these thoughts grew too heavy. I didn\\'t want to be there anymore. I wanted to be nowhere, not awake, not asleep, not alive, not dead. I spent my time with people that encouraged all my doubts, and I pushed away people that cared. I rarely went to class and even if I did, I scraped by on the assignments. I lived for the moments of escape when I could go to parties and drink and hook up with guys, no matter how repelled I was by them. Outside of those few hours of escape, I couldn\\'t sleep. I never went to the cafeteria with friends or even to get a real meal. I only ate Lean Cuisines that my parents had bought me at the beginning of the year. When I ran out, I ate solely Pizza Rolls and peanut M&amp;Ms. I didn\\'t do laundry once in those few months and barely took showers. The only time I put any effort into my personal appearance was when I went to a party because all I wanted was to be perceived as \"carefree\" and \"sexy,\" not the lazy slob that I thought I was. Even then, I wore wildly inappropriate clothing compared to what everyone else at my college wore - one time a girl yelled out to me, \"You\\'re going to get raped!\" Another said judgmentally to a friend, \"She\\'s not wearing pants.\" (I was wearing sequined booty shorts, okay). My only happy moments that semester were with a boy that then tried to sexually assault me with a visiting alumnus. His excuse was that he wanted to get into the alumnus\\' frat by impressing that brother. When he tried to apologize the next morning, I told him he shouldn\\'t apologize. I was so disconnected from my body, I didn\\'t even view it as mine anymore. After that, I didn\\'t blame him and still spent most of my \\'free\\' time with him. (Free meaning when I wasn\\'t laying on my bed trying to gather enough strength to even leave my room, going to a party or the rare occasion I went to class or very very rarely attended a sorority event.)\\n\\nMy last night at that school, my theory that I had borderline personality disorder was weighing on me. I had been thinking about it for a couple of weeks after I had finally figured out that my behavior and thoughts were not the typical college experience, thanks to my extremely honest roommate &amp; sorority sister. She told me that other girls in the sorority thought I was trying to \"fuck with their guy friends\" and slept with too many people. I tried to go to the student health center earlier that day. When I stated, \"I think I have borderline personality disorder,\" they just said, \"What do you want us to do?\" The only action they were equipped to take was to call the on-duty counselor who had to drive 40 minutes to get to campus. When I told her about my self harm and drinking and promiscuity she replied, \"How does that make you different than any other student?\" This further cemented my past notion that I was just weak: the numbness and loneliness - the desire to feel anything at all - was normal, and I just had a huge character flaw by not having the strength to be \\'normal.\\' \\n\\nThat night I got wasted and tried to swallow a whole bottle of caffeine pills at my friend\\'s house. My intention was to induce a heart attack. He was one of the only people that I knew understood what I was feeling, but I never got a chance to tell him how close to the edge I was since his freshman girlfriend and two of her friends were with him that night. Not that it was his responsibility, but I just wanted confirmation that something wasn\\'t right with me. While I was at his house, I tried to stay true to my \\'carefree,\\' \\'fun\\' person that I tried so hard portray while his girlfriend and her friends complimented my shirt and hair. It made me feel like such a fraud. Towards the end of the night, after I had swallowed those pills, my friend tried to get me to throw them up and then drove me to my dorm where I couldn\\'t even find my room. I stumbled around and ran into the RA that had just gotten out of the shower and clung to him. I was scared and confused and felt so alone. I eventually got to my room and started cutting my already scarred wrist with baby scissors. I tried to cut into my femoral artery with those scissors as well, which was entirely unsuccessful. I settled for cutting my knee. At that moment, campus safety knocked on the door. I kept calm when they asked their usual questions, \"Have you been drinking tonight?,\" etc., until they asked me to show them my wrists. That\\'s when I panicked. Started screaming and crying uncontrollably. They escorted me to their office. I later learned one of the officers asked my roommate if I slept around. While I was incoherently yelling, an officer handed me a phone. It was my mom, and I cried that a death of a young man I knew in high school was my fault, and that I could have done something. (Background: His death wasn\\'t my fault in any conceivable way. He OD\\'ed. I barely knew him &amp; didn\\'t even know he was an addict, but I had a huge crush on him at the time and never acted on it. Through my warped logic, if I had been braver and talked to him, I could have \\'saved\\' him.) \\n\\nThe next day she was at my school ready to pick me up. She had flown on the next available flight to get to me. When I returned home, I went through months of therapy and psychiatry and yoga and meditation all arranged all by my mom. In the beginning, I was okay. Broken down and exhausted but seemingly on the mend. On some level, I was relieved that I had finally been diagnosed with something (went from depression to bipolar II to a depressive mood disorder). I worked really hard with my therapist to understand my guilt, disgust and trauma, which ironically had been entirely driven by ways I tried to cope with my depression. However, fully expecting to go back to college for the next semester, I was informed that I was not allowed to return yet. When I chose to leave in the middle of the semester, the dean didn\\'t share the information that they had never let a student return from health leave until after six months of treatment. I had withdrawn from all my classes and sacrificed a semester\\'s worth of my parents money thinking that I would be returning shortly and only a semester behind.\\n\\nAfter that initial blow, my parents eventually gave me more freedom, I met and got involved with a guy that got me more into substances. He was going through issues of his own, which is why I connected with him. One morning, my parents tried to wake me up but couldn\\'t. No need to go into further detail, but it was one step forward and two steps back (I no longer wanted to be \\'nowhere\\' but was now using... alcohol... frequently). Despite alcohol being one of my main coping mechanisms, I was fortunate not to develop any dependencies or addictions.\\n\\nA handful of months later, after my parents had taken away my phone and forced me to be supervised by them every night, I was accepted into a local university. I had also found a new therapist and psychiatrist. Their words stuck to me: 1) \"Depression sucks and it most likely will be with you forever but there are ways of treating it.\" and 2) \"You get to a point in your recovery where you can\\'t blame your depression anymore. You just have to stand up and do your homework/go to your job/go to class.\" I was also lucky enough to have a couple professors that understood on a basic level what I was going through. One told me to show up to class no matter how miserable I was. I didn\\'t bother to explain that depression wasn\\'t about being miserable, but from there on out I did everything within my emotional power to go to class, even if I had drank before (that happened a couple times) or didn\\'t participate (happened almost every time). I ended up getting a C or D in the class, but I take that as a win since I easily could have failed. Another professor asked student services to reach out to me after I hadn\\'t shown up to class a couple weeks in a row. I learned there will be a lot of people that don\\'t get it and don\\'t want to get it, but the one or two that do make all the difference in the world.\\n\\nThroughout my time at the new university, there were a lot of ups (meeting a close friend and actually making personal connections with people, excelling at the courses in my major) and downs (failing multiple classes and having to proactively withdraw due to \\'special circumstances,\\' finishing an entire bottle of wine in an hour, crying and writing gibberish about how guilty I felt then inviting some random 30 year old I had met on Tinder over to my dorm room), but slowly I was piecing it together. I eventually got an on-campus job, then a full time internship then a full-time job.\\n\\nWhile I\\'m not perfect these days, I\\'ve been at a job I never would have dreamed of for the past two and half years and have gotten a promotion.\\n\\nStill, sometimes when the depression gets the best of me, I think thatâ\\x80\\x99s who I really am. This broken, beaten down person that\\'s ashamed of basically her entire young adulthood. I fear that I don\\'t want anything of substance. That I canâ\\x80\\x99t find anything of substance. That I don\\'t even know what I want. No path. No passion. When it gets that bad, it takes every ounce of strength I have to fight it. \\n\\nEven on good days, I can feel like it\\'s in the back my mind. I\\'m terrified that it will come back, and I won\\'t be able to control it. I\\'ll give in to the thoughts that say I\\'m not good enough. You\\'ll never be good enough. Everything you\\'ve dared to want will slip through your fingers, and you won\\'t even know. All I do is think about how far I\\'ve come from that girl who swallowed a dozen caffeine pills. That girl who  thought she\\'d never be happy. And it gives me just enough strength to deny those feelings and smile.\\n\\nI hope this wasn\\'t too personal, but I wanted to be as raw and honest as possible. \\n\\nThanks.', 'I began to openly discuss my depression to my friends. It was very painful to discuss but I think it\\'s a step in the right direction.\\nUp to now, I have never discussed my depression with anyone besides my husband and my therapist. I have slight PTSD from when I was kid and a teacher had been \"concerned\" for me by some disturbing behavior. I felt even more misunderstood and felt so much anguish that I became really good at disguising my depression. I hid it under a fake, likable, version of myself because I wanted to fit in and feel like I belong.\\n\\nCurrently, my closest friends are my coworkers but they the most judgmental people I\\'ve known. We became close by commiserating together at work. Fast forward a few years, I am finally starting to feel better after seeking help for my depression. I\\'ve been seeing a therapist for over a year, began taking antidepressants two months ago, and have been taking cognitive behavioral therapy sessions. As I begin to feel better, I also feel more miserable hanging out with my friends.\\n\\nI decided to be more open with the people around me about my depression. I revealed it today for the first time with one of my closest friends. It was incredibly scary for me... I haven\\'t felt this vulnerable in a long time. My friends typically see me as a guarded person with a hard exterior, but I felt tears welling in my eyes. He was very surprised to hear, but I\\'m not the first person he knows with depression so it was reassuring to know he didn\\'t think I was some sort of freak. He also commended me for taking steps in getting better and encouraged me to continue talking about it. It was a positive experience overall.\\n\\nI then decided to tell another friend later in the day because I was feeling good after the discussion I had earlier. It went a little differently though... His first question was, \"what do you have to be depressed about?!\" which instantly flooded my mind with negative feelings of remorse. I tried my best to keep calm and answer his questions honestly. I explained that it\\'s not any thing or anyone that is making me *feel* depressed. It\\'s a mental condition I have which causes me to be in a persistent state of sadness and worthlessness. He asked me if I understand where Eric is coming from (his bipolar nephew that he sometimes mentions), and I said yes. He then seemed to become more curious and asked me many questions about what it\\'s like. \\n\\nIn the end, I feel like I educated him on depression and hopefully helped debunk his belief that depression is just a feeling that people should be able to snap out of. I honestly don\\'t think I could have these conversations if I was in the state I was even a month ago. Even today, I felt myself slipping into the familiar downward spiral. I don\\'t know what kept me composed today, but I\\'m so proud of myself for making it through the conversation without snapping or becoming defensive. Perhaps if I had these conversations in reverse order, it could\\'ve been a completely different experience.\\n\\nI hope this inspires others to talk about it, seek help and be open to receiving it. It was quite uncomfortable but I am happy to create an opening for other people to understand what we are going through.\\n\\n', 'Women ignore me, even here, they think I\\'m unworthy or too ugly to be helped. I even have the stats to prove it. Why am I so undeserving of love?\\nI made a post yesterday today asking for help as to why I\\'m undatable and why no women wants to go out with me.

Everyone else ignored me. 1/250. 249/250 women think I\\'m ugly or not worthy of a relationship. Think about that. That\\'s how unwanted I am. What if every 3 minutes, someone told you \"you\\'re ugly, no one wants you, no one cares for you, and you will die forever alone\"? That\\'s the life I might as well live in. Let\\'s not also forget the people that made fun of me too. I mean, what do you want me to do to get your replies, ladies? Do you want me to give you gold? Will that incentivize you to reply?\\n\\nThe sidebar says \"A supportive space for anyone struggling with depression.\" and yet people make fun of me, don\\'t want to help, and call me ugly.

I\\'m not qualified to be a human apparently. I bet most people my age have had 3-4 SOs, and I\\'ve had a big fat 0. Even other people with anxiety and depression can get into relationships, when other people see them, their mental illness makes them want to care for them, but for me, they run away. It\\'s apparent in this subreddit too. Not even worthy of being spoken to from a woman. ', \"Am I going insane or is this normal? Zoning out\\nI was always praised for my memory.

Here\\'s a short sample: \\n\\n- I hate the hours (7A-7P 3 days a week, 7A-2P 2 days a week; an hour lunch break was promised in the new hire handbook but is frowned upon by staff as a lack of commitment/dedication) \\n\\n- There are religious currents, including periodic \\'prayer meetings\\' throughout the day.

But getting communication back with him is all I want. There are no exceptions.\\n\\nSo hereâ\\x80\\x99s my idea. Just for fun I livestream games on YouTube. I do it for fun, not for fame, I donâ\\x80\\x99t play those popular games, I play the ones that no one plays. Itâ\\x80\\x99s unlikely for a video to get more than 100 views. But Iâ\\x80\\x99ve considered starting a new channel. I will livestream games, post videos about my custom Guitar Hero songs (I do that for fun too) and just pretty much show that Iâ\\x80\\x99m having fun. But the big goal of the channel will be to â\\x80\\x9cget my friend backâ\\x80\\x9d. Thatâ\\x80\\x99ll be the whole idea. That will be written on every video. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s what the channel art will say. Think of it as a gofundme, only Iâ\\x80\\x99m not asking for money, Iâ\\x80\\x99m asking for support from the public to hear my story, hear what Iâ\\x80\\x99m doing, and to be there with me when my friend does deliver.\\n\\nHereâ\\x80\\x99s the catch. For obvious reasons, his name will never be revealed. No one will have any idea who my friend is. But little by little, I will try to reveal the channel to him. Itâ\\x80\\x99ll start with the channel being named â\\x80\\x9cIanâ\\x80\\x9d, then sooner or later add my last name. As time goes on Iâ\\x80\\x99ll try and find ways to give him clues about the channel without actually telling him anything.\\n\\nThe big dream is that he eventually discovers the channel, and with whatever support there is, he will see how much Iâ\\x80\\x99ve mentally improved over however long it takes.\\n\\nThis all may sound totally silly, totally bogus, yeah, maybe this will never work in a million years.

Dealing with the sudden appearance of depression has been a nightmare and a half to deal with to say the least. So in response, I regularly attempt to interpret the spiral of self loathing thoughts and whirlwind of emotions that march throughout my mind. \\n\\nMy initial reaction to a diagnosis of major depression and multiple failed suicide attempts has been to run away from everything that reeks of painful memories, both theoretically and literally:\\n\\n* I write this post 7,000 kilometres from my home country, in Japan, where I aim to live for the next couple of years. \\n* â\\x80\\x8eI've ghosted those whom I use to call my close friends.\\n* I left all social media in order to avoid contacting people that I knew, and because looking at how happy other people were brought me down. \\n* â\\x80\\x8eI changed my image drastically over the past year as an outward expression of the fact that I'm trying to change as a person.\\n\\nIt's here in Japan that I've come to a terrifying realisation. I can't run from depression. Here I am, in a country where people speak a totally different language and immersed in a totally different culture to my own, writing a post about depression. \\n\\nRecently, I was walking the streets in search for job opportunities when I sunk into a depressed mood and began thinking about my place in the world (which always turns out well). Nothing actually matters. We work in order to pay rent, in order to stay in the same place, so that we can reliably keep a job so that we can pay rent. It's in this meaninglessness that humans as social beings look to others for comfort. Our lives are but a meaningless speck in an expanding universe. That's quite the depressing thought... And it is. But why is it that when another body's lying on top of mine, or when I'm held in a warm embrace, this thought doesn't have any impact on me?\\n\\nI've done quite a bit of thinking by myself,  and have talked to a bunch of people from back in the psychiatric ward on what 'fixes' us. And the unfortunate answer for most of us is... Nothing. We can't be fixed. It's just how our minds work. But what if we don't have to be fixed? The hardest part about depression for me, is the intensity of the loneliness I feel. When I'm at my worst, I'm so focused on my own loneliness and the meaninglessness of my relationships, that the few connections I do have, I dismiss. Now, this isn't the case for all people suffering from depression. For a lot of people, their negative emotions are driven by a sense of worthlessness,  meaninglessness or sadness. \\n\\nBut the general consensus is, although we can't 'fix' ourselves, we can have people around us to support us when we're at our lowest. And it makes sense that as social beings, human intimacy provides us with a safety net for when depression's hitting us the hardest. \\n\\nUnfortunately for most of us, the type of physical and emotional intimacy that we strive for is unobtainable. In my life, depression's caused me to push away the people that I've spent time building connections with, and has limited the amount of contact I've had with strangers and people that I COULD connect with.\\n\\nI think it's ironic. It's ironic that in such an overpopulated world, depression is such a big issue. We're the people that need intimacy the most, so you'd think we'd be in a position where intimacy is more readily available. But that's not how the world works. Our lives are still meaningless. We still hate ourselves.

Let me preface this by saying I've been diagnosed with bipolar tendencies (i guess you can't diagnose bipolar disorder until you're 18), severe depression, chronic anxiety and body dysmorphia. I've been hospitalized for a suicide attempt almost two years ago, and I've struggled with self harm since fourth grade. I was bullied relentlessly throughout elementary and middle school. Thankfully, i've been clean for a year, and after the hospital I got on medication and things started to get better for a while. My senior year has been great so far but it's starting to get bad again. I used to be a social smoker, but now I'm completely dependent on marijuana for everything. I'm not hungry unless I smoke and I can't fall asleep unless I smoke. I need it to get through the day. I can't go to college, because I can't afford it and my mom says she can't consign on a loan for me. I totally understand that too, because if my dad were to die she'd be in trouble and in tens of thousands of dollars in debt. I'm just sad because I want to go away like all of my friends but I can't. My dad is most likely going to lose his job soon apparently too, which is going to put us in poverty. My mom and dad fight all the time, and hate each other. They've both talked about getting a divorce to me exclusively. I pretend like it doesn't bother me, but it does. My dad is addicted to prescription painkillers, and locks himself in his room the minute he gets home. He comes to my choir concerts, plays, and musicals but leaves almost immediately after it starts, which hurts me a lot. I pretend like I don't care about that either. The thing that hurts me the most now is my dog was put down today. She was my first dog. I was allergic to dogs when I was way younger. I grew out of it and it took so long to find her, because my mom was set on picking the perfect dog for us. We found her, and now she's gone. I was the one who stayed in the room with her, because my mom couldn't do it. I pet and comforted her while she died. I've never had to cope with someone dying before, and it's so hard. She was just a dog, but I still loved her so much. I want her back so bad. My problems are so minor compared to some people's, but I'm so sad right now. I don't know what to do. This is the first time in a while that I've wanted to kill myself, but I don't want to go down that road again. I just don't know how to cope anymore. \", \"How to deal with people who can't seem to be bothered with you?\\nQuestion is fairly self-explanatory. \\n\\nI ask this because recently (within the past 6 or so months), my supposed 'friends' have started to become quite distant with me and it's making me feel like total crap. They rarely ever contact me despite me having reached out a couple of times. It's all very fragmented. What hurts the most is I see them interacting with their other friends (on facebook etc.) and also that they have been online recently but still have not answered my messages. My friends used to be great, they used to consider me their closest friend and would reply quickly etc. But now I feel like I have been replaced and I have nobody left.

Or Just in a Bad Rut? (Long Post)\\nI've never really felt like I've had depression before. I'm turning 24 at the end of the week, and this is the first time I've honestly wondered about myself. Usually, I'm pretty happy about things, and my outlook on life has always been realistically positive. But, lately, I just feel absolutely lost. And this morning, after I got off of work, I sat and cried. I'm not much of crier at all, and the only other time I've cried in the last ten years has been at an uncle's funeral recently. \\n\\nThis past summer, for me, was a pretty great time. I was in a relationship with a girl who really made me happy, more than any other one had before. I seemed to be having fun every weekend, whether with her or with some friends of mine or family. I had a lot on the horizon, and a lot to look forward to. I was getting ready to finish up my degree, and it seemed like things were going in the right direction. The only thing that was a problem then was that my job was a third shift job, but it was 3 days a week, and usually 11-13 hour shifts, meaning I had time to do stuff outside of it. But, my then girlfriend and another friend had solid connections that they thought could help me land a much better job where they worked, which would carry me pretty well until I finished school. Things were looking up for me. I was pretty happy. \\n\\nI guess things started to slip for me when my uncle got hit with a terminal diagnosis in August. At 47, and with young children, nobody in the family was prepared to lose him. And the disease, an incredibly rare degenerative brain disease, was the same one that killed my grandmother 11 years ago. We lost him in early September. The thing with this disease that nobody in the family is talking about is that, if it hits twice within the same bloodline, there's a 50% chance that living relatives within the bloodline will get it in their 40's or 50's. There's nine of us left in the immediate family, including my mother, my brother and myself. And since it's so rare, there is absolutely no treatment plan. \\n\\nThat, for me, was a lot to process. I'm not worried about myself, but the idea that I could still be losing relatives to this disease for years sucks. It's hard enough seeing it happen twice. \\n\\nDuring this time, things started to fall apart with me and my then-girlfriend as well. I kind of hid out with her for a while, because my family was perpetually sad and in a state of distress. And since I worked nights, I was kind of isolated. Things started to hit a rut between me and her when she started her own treatment for depression. I tried to be supportive of her, while doing whatever anyone in my family needed while my uncle was sick. She really seemed happy that I was there for her, (and things really worked out since she lived so close to my uncle anyways, and I could bounce back and forth from place to place on my days off.)\\n\\nBoth my family and my girlfriend were very important to me, and I guess helping them out made me feel good about myself, even though the situation was shitty. I kind of let school fall to the back-burner though. And I kind of neglected my other friends for a while as well. But between work, my family, and her, I was consistently busy. \\n\\nMy uncle passed in early September, sending most of my family into a pretty bad state, and only a week later, my girlfriend decided she was done with me, because she was afraid that if she recovered from her depression with me around, then she'd equate me with happiness, and if I left her then she wouldn't be able to recover. (Which ended up being mostly a made up way of saying, I don't love you anymore, but I don't have the courage to tell you.) Obviously, it wasn't fair to her to be stuck with me if she wasn't happy with me, but there were so many better opportunities for her to break things off, and she chose the one that was the most tedious and mentally draining for me. My state of mind after it ended wasn't great at all, and I said some very mean things to her after it ended, (I guess, at the time, I thought it was constructive criticism, but it was all just mean and awful and embarrassing.) Understandably, she hasn't talked to me since, and I feel like I burned any bridge towards reconciling with her.\\n\\nI missed my uncle a lot, but doing favors for his wife and kids helped me at least feel like I was contributing. My mother's still kind of a mess about it, but she has my father for support. My brother had a hard time for a while too, but his job keeps him well occupied. But, lately, for me, the things I can help with anymore have been fewer and fewer. \\n\\nRight now, I just want to fast forward to like March or April. I don't want to deal with my birthday, since the plans I had with my ex-girlfriend are obviously not happening anymore, most of my friends are busy with work and school, and my family is still not back to being normal. Nobody seems to want to do much for my birthday anyways, which is, for lack of a better word, normal for me. When I got home from work this morning, I cried thinking about it all. I've never had that kind of emotional reaction to anything before. \\n\\nThe only thing I look forward to in life at the moment is my night or two out with a friend a week. The holidays are going to be rough on my family, I know now that my ex girlfriend (who I still care for and would probably take back) has completely moved on from me, and the once promising prospect of a new job isn't nearly as likely as it used to be. And, school kind of got caught up in the shuffle, and I'm not where I wanted to be with that, either. I'm going to be out on my own come January, which might help, but right now I'm just dreading the next month. I feel like the things I care about are slipping further and further out of my control, and it's hard for me to deal with.\\n\\nI don't know if this is just a rough patch in my life, or a sign that I have a more serious problem. But right now, I have very few people that I can be 100% open with, and it's been tough. Work is, for lack of a better word, quiet for me, meaning I spend most of my time thinking, and it doesn't help much. Since I've never really had a stretch like this before where I've been as mentally drained and just sad, I'm not really sure what to do. But there's very little on the horizon that I'm looking forward to, and I'm worried about that. \\n\\ntl;dr: Stretch of life events, most of which out of my control, have wreaked havoc on my emotional state. I now feel kind of hopeless. Don't know if it's just a rough patch in life, or something worse.\\n\", 'My dad died today\\nSo Iâ\\x80\\x99m 16, coming on 17 next month. \\n\\nToday my dad died at 42. \\n\\nHe hasnâ\\x80\\x99t been doing so well for a few days. Yesterday his legs gave out and he was stuck on the bed with his lungs in pain if he lay on his back. For 24 hours, no sleep, food, or drink. Many more problems that I cannot remember, and heâ\\x80\\x99s been feeling like shit emotionally too due to family issues. \\n\\nMy mom went to check in on him before going to the store. Since yesterday sheâ\\x80\\x99s been trying to get him to go to the hospital but of course heâ\\x80\\x99s stubborn. When she came back from the store, she decided sheâ\\x80\\x99d have the ambulance come and pick him up because he REALLY needed to go in. Slurring his words, despite actually being sober in the mornings. When she went back to get his consent over phone to get picked up for the ambulance, he was out cold already. Lips purple, cold, lifeless. It had been only 30-40 minutes since she last saw him, alive, or whatever was left of his life. \\n\\nI was there to see a fresh dead corpse. \\n\\nMy dad. My *dad.*\\n\\nTo say my world is crashing around me is an understatement. Iâ\\x80\\x99m just a fucking kid, going through my own battles with myself and now my dad is just *gone.* I didnâ\\x80\\x99t have the best relationship with him but he was a really, really good guy and this stings like a bitch. \\n\\nAll of it feels unreal and at the same time scarily real. \\n\\nEverything is numb. \\n\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m lost. ', \"So I finally realized something this week...\\nBeen stuck in an episode since my birthday (just turned 25, as per my last post). Can't remember the last time I ate a proper meal. Sleep cycle is fucked. Haven't left the house in a week. Funny enough, I had planned on hanging out and doing some reading in a cafe today... only to never leave the house. All this time, I've been thinking how much I yearn to have someone, anyone, physically check in. Or a partner to cuddle with, hug, and hold me tight.... but all that just fades into the empty void. \\n\\nI used to be Christian, and used to pray. Now that I'm not, I'm realizing how truly alone I am in dealing with all this. My friends all live in the city center. They have jobs and livelihoods. Ultimately, I have to physically do things by myself. No one's gonna save me. It's heartbreaking. Physically, I'm just so alone.\", 'Can anyone cheer me up?\\nApparently, my dad used to work in another country. While he was away, my mom allegedly cheated on him several times. The only source of mine is my cousin, who gets the info from my sister. So I guess it is true. And to think about it, she did wear a lot of makeup back then. Not the normal amount I mean. To keep it short, when this hit me, I could not imagine her cheating on my dad. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve also heard that they are not divorcing because of me, which is plain stupid. All in all, I am pretty much down, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve never thought that she would be capable of doing such a thing. (19 year old guy here)', \"I Empathize More With the Dead Than I Feel Bad for the Living\\nThere have been a few times in the past few years where I found out someone I went to high school with died of whatever means. But within the past few months, whenever I found out someone died, I didn't really feel bad for their family, I mostly was kind of jealous that they were gone and I was still here.\\n\\nFor example, my mom manages a nursing floor at a hospital. She told me one of her nurse's daughters died of a deadly disease at 20. And all I could think about was at 21 all I could think was how jealous I was of the deceased young woman, and how lucky she was. No ill will to her, I hope she rests in peace and that her family is coping.\\n\\nAnother example. When I was in high school, someone I knew had an older brother than went out drinking one night and when he came home, he died, choking on his own vomit.\\n\\nAgain, I feel like there should be a lot of cautionary tales in this, but mostly I just wish I was the one that was dead.\", \":)\\nSo yesterday was my 18th birthday, and here my dumbass was expecting it to be different than all my other ones, but boy was I wrong. It's nice to know that no one gives a fuck about you. You can cry, and scream all you want but at the end of the day, no one is gonna be able to understand you, and the deep well that has been buried within your mind. So what if you grew up rejected by every girl, guy, and person? So what if you've just turned 18 and endured waves upon waves of mental abuse? At the end of the day, when you're laying in your bed, and your demons are starting to swallow you whole and fill up the bowl, what do you do? You face it. You indulge yourself in them until the pain is numb, and you can't feel anything anymore. It may not be healthy, but it's better than suffering. Happy fucking birthday bro, have your cake.\", \"My grandma is dying and life doesn't stop\\nSo I work full-time and go to grad school part-time. I'm busy 7 days a week between work, class, and homework/housework. Normally this is a very good thing for me as it keeps the depression and other mental illness at bay.\\n\\nBut my grandma's dying. She was put into hospice over the weekend and can't do much of anything anymore. I love her so much as my grandparents/mom's side of the family have been the only stable family I've ever had. My grandmother is an amazing woman. She graduated as valedictorian of her college class. She raised 7 amazing children (all college grads and successful in their fields) and has 14 grandchildren and 5 great-grandchildren. She's 90 and has lived an amazing life.\\n\\nIt's still so hard to say goodbye. I've been doing my best to spend time with her and my visiting family but the grief and depression are kicking my ass. I can't do anything. I have a huge paper due this week and work has been insanely stressful. I can't even manage to get my laundry done and I'm buying and eating shit food that is bankrupting me.\\n\\nI don't know what to do. Life won't stop, and I'm so stressed that my whole body is breaking out in rashes and I'm sore all the time.

What\\'s bothering me is that lately, things have been weighing down HARD. My patience is paper thin from years of abuse and I feel like in these last few months, I\\'m receding into myself because I don\\'t have patience for even reasonable flaws in other people. I\\'m tired of being stepped on and dealing with the hand I\\'ve been dealt in life (I am CLAWING my way out of poverty ALONE, caused by a narcissistic parent kicking me out and attempting to kill me at 17 -- just made 21). I finally told my boyfriend today, not mincing any words, that I\\'m so fucking tired of being optimistic. That I\\'m tired of pretending anything is going to be fine because alot of the times I feel like it won\\'t. \"Faking it till you make it\" has worked for me in the past, definitely, but being optimistic to KEEP myself from being depressing/depressed is not fucking working for me. It\\'s idiotic. It\\'s not that I think things are 100% pointless -- I\\'m working on a set of skills right now to get myself out of my minimum wage job to get a much better one. \\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nBut I\\'m just exhausted from trying to not worry other people and not expressing how fucking done I am with everything. Is this normal? Is this healthy? Like I said, not giving up. I\\'m working forward. I just feel like the fake optimism is an extra step and a formality at this point and honestly complaining today made me feel better, not going to lie, as I do my best to not do that because I feel like I\\'m \"pushing myself on others\" (my situation is so bleak that people almost never know what to say in response anyway because there is nothing close to an immediate solution). But I feel angry and spiteful that people who have been given everything or that can recieve assistance from family telling me how I have to \"perk up\" because It\\'s \"what they do when things are hard\" when their \"hard\" is \"I stayed up all the time in college to study and it\\'s hard\" vs \"I stay up all the time to study my new skillset AND risk my life every day on a chinese scooter that gives out at times to do deliveries in all of the elements to make a wage that isn\\'t even livable, having one or more panic attacks a day because of dangerous drivers\".\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nI also feel bad because my SO is always trying to be an optimist. He\\'s somehow perfected this even being depressed himself. Sometimes that bleeds through but he\\'s usually hyper optimistic and it\\'s exhausting. We\\'ve gotten in arguments in the past when he was less acquainted with my depression because if I wasn\\'t immediately cheered up by him making jokes while I\\'m crying to make me laugh (let me work through my emotions, damn... It works sometimes but not ALL the time, seriously), he\\'d get insulted and take it personally that a single joke was not enough to change my outlook on life and fix all my issues. I feel kind of like I got a little snippy with him when I complained earlier and kept cutting him off and telling him how hopeless I felt and telling him, emotionlessly, \"I just don\\'t care to be optimistic. I don\\'t give a fuck. What\\'s that going to do? I\\'m already tired, it\\'s just going to make me more tired\" because I had a feeling that that was where he was going to go with it. I feel bad because he\\'s just trying to help. But I am so fucking tired. So tired. I have a hard time doing anything if I don\\'t think it has a point (Even if I hate a job, I\\'m still getting paid, and there is therefore a point to it) and I just didn\\'t see  the point of doing all this. I think I do to make him happy and worry less about me. But I\\'m so upset that I don\\'t have the capacity right now to do more things to emotionally keep him comfortable. That\\'s stupid.

I know how incredibly hard you all have worked this quarter, and how hard you will push yourselves during this final stretch, but there are 2 other things I want you to know:\\n\\n1) I, the other TAs, and our professor will not be disappointed if you do not perform as well you want, so you shouldn't be either. Tests and grades are not always the best reflection of you as students/scientists, and they are most certainly are not a reflection of your worth as a person. All a test assesses is how much content you remember and how well you can take a test at a certain time on a certain day. It is simply one data point, and as you should all know by now, 1 data point is not representative of the population. For many of you, you have other finals/presentations/responsibilities going on, and it'll be difficult to find time to study. For others, you may want so badly to study a lot, but can't because you are so stressed and anxious. I personally deal with anxiety and depression, and I know how utterly frustrating it is when your mind doesn't work as well as you want it to. \\n\\n2) Take care of yourself. Eat good food, get some sleep, spend time with people you love. \\n\\nSo, while you prepare for finals these next weeks, keep these two things in mind. You are all incredibly curious, kind, intelligent and important people.

For the last 7 years it\\'s gotten worst, I\\'m 20 at the moment. When I was 13 I was raped occasionally. Being raped when it first happen didn\\'t bother me as much because I didnt understand what was happening until years later. What did bother me at the time was that I felt alone. I\\'ve always felt alone, never felt like anyone cared for me or about me. I fought with my mom and step dad a lot which made me feel even more lonely. I never talked about feeling lonely to anyone because I was always embarrassed about it and still do. Because me and my parents had a rocky relationship I would be abused by both at times. One time I was arguing with my mom and she ended up getting a 2 by 4 and started hitting me with it. I never rasied my hands at my parents, just talked a lot of shit and was an asshole to them. My parents kicked me out of their house when I was 14. I ended up living with my grandpa. This made me feel unwanted and even more lonely now that my parents gave up on me. I lived with my grandpa for about 9 months before he sent me back to my parents because he couldn\\'t \"afford\" to keep me. I wasn\\'t an asshole to my grandpa nor was I mean to him, I just was a teen who stayed up late and took long showers. My grandpa giving up on me was heartbreaking for me. I felt like no one wanted me and if I ended everything then everything would be better. I didn\\'t even last a week at my parents house, they shipped me off to live with some family who lived in the rural country area instead of the city. I lived there for maybe 4 months and finished my freshmen year of high school there. I didn\\'t feel welcomed anywhere I went and for the most part I felt more beyond alone. Majority of the time at my uncle\\'s I was in my room, alone and desperate for a friend. After 4 lonely months of really being alone I was given back to my parents again. After coming home broken I learned to keep to myself. No one wanted me and no one cared. \\n\\nWhen I got back home I was sent to an all boy high school. Once again I had to go to a new school and try to fit in somehow. I was lonely for a while until I met this girl. I\\'m afraid to write her name incase she ever reads this and it hurts reading/writing it but I need to get this off my chest. I met this beautiful girl named Cindy at a school function. She went to the all girl school down a couple streets. Both all gender schools would make events for each other to get students that social interaction. Anyways I meet this beautiful girl named Cindy, she was nice to me and I was nice to her. We dated for over a year and while it lasted it was nice. The way she broke up with me literally broke me. I was having a really sad day and told her about how I struggle with really bad depression and that I have suicidal thoughts. Her response was \"oh\" and she slowly stopped talking to me. Eventually she stopped talking to me and when she did talk to me she made excuses about not having time to talk to me. She was my only friend, the only person I was close to. She couldn\\'t be there for me when I needed her most, when I needed a friend most. So I stayed alone thinking maybe school was too much for her at the moment. Then one day I get on Facebook only to see her on it, I clicked on her page and saw that she had been on hanging out with friends and having the time of her life. She slowly broke me, I couldn\\'t handle it and called her to confront her about it. She made excuses and talked about how she didnt have time for me at the moment, so she hung up and left it alone. I was reaching my breaking point, I was going to commit suicide. I sent her a text message talking about how I needed her to talk to me and be a friend because I was getting worst. She never responded to me however she did get in contact with my school to let them know what I was dealing with. \\n\\nI was so embarrassed that she did this to me, I felt betrayed and hurt that she made me the schools problem instead of hers. It hurt ne so bad. I was embarrassed that the school knew, I was embarrassed that my parents knew now. I wanted to kill myself more than ever now. I was so hurt by this and was angry at Cindy. I went home and tried stabbing myself. My mom went in my room to talk to me, just so happened at that moment I had a kitchen knife in my hand to stab myself. My mon fought me over it and sent me to a psychiatric hospital. I stayed there until December 23rd. At the hospital I tried killing myself twice. First time was when the guards/residents give you cracks, I ate the crackers but stuffed the wrapper down my throat. One if the residents heard me making choking nosies and came in to save me. Second time was when I started swallowing my food instead of chewing on it to choke me out again. They put me on these medications that didn\\'t help but I acted like they did so I can go home. I was alone again, Cindy stopped talking to me. It broke my heart and broke me. \\n\\nIt\\'s been 4 years since Cindy and I\\'m not over it. It still kills me about what happened. I\\'m still depressed and suicidal. I honestly wish I did kill myself when I had the courage to do so. There hasn\\'t been much for me other than pain. I haven\\'t moved on and I haven\\'t gotten over everything. This was my deepest darkest moment in my life so far. I wish I could say things got better for me since all of that but true is they haven\\'t. I\\'m still the same lonely person I\\'ve always felt I\\'ve been for the longest time. I\\'ve tried dating in college and I\\'ve never had feelings for anyone. Don\\'t have many friends and don\\'t have any real reasons to be here still.

Since I came to realise this, I\\'ve noticed an increase in my general mood, or at least I\\'ve become better at coping with going outside, shopping etc.', 'Having a really bad stretch of days..\\nHi all,\\n\\nI know this sub moves kinda fast but I just wanted to vent, hopefully some of you read this..\\n\\nSo my story is that I\\'ve had depression and social anxiety for about 15 years or so (at least that\\'s when I recall starting to feel \"off\".. I\\'m 29 now).. Because of my poor decision to bottle things up and accept that I\\'m unhappy I put off seeking help until about a month or two ago in which I started going to therapy. It had taken a rather bad mental fallout that occurred in early December for me to finally reach out for help.\\n\\nIn my sessions we\\'ve been working on techniques to combat both my SA and depression, these include going to places alone such as coffee shops, yoga classes, shopping malls, etc. (Keep in mind I have \"functioning\" social anxiety where I can physically be around people but I\\'m extremely uncomfortable the entire time and have a very difficult time interacting with people).. The thought process being that my depression stems from loneliness and my SA contributes to that.. It\\'s been a big step for me to try and go out on my own, but I\\'ve been doing it almost every day even though it doesn\\'t seem to be creating any improvement.\\n\\nUnfortunately the last few days have been incredibly difficult, I\\'m getting a very sick feeling of hopelessness and worry that my life is now just constantly shuffling around desperately trying to find something in the world that will \"fix\" me. I tried to sit at home last night to give myself a break and I couldn\\'t even do that, I started becoming consumed by those bad thoughts and began having a panic attack.. So I decided to just go drive aimlessly even though we were in the middle of a snow storm..\\n\\nI feel miserable again today and I\\'m just running out of steam to keep going, I really don\\'t know what to do anymore.. I\\'m exhausted from constantly forcing myself into uncomfortable public situations but at the same time my home feels like a prison.. I have nobody to talk to or gain support from anymore, the couple of friends that I have all have their own lives with wives and kids and my family has been out of my life for 10 years and for good reason.. I know nobody has answers as to what I should do but I just needed to rant\\n', \"Severe Ibs and depression combo is a death sentence\\nHi \\n\\nI posted a few times on this forum last year April sometine due to my depression and I'm posting again because well, it's back. So I'm just going to write a few things about myself and why I'm posting here.\\n\\nIm a 20 year old guy from London, England and I've been depressed for about 2 years now. I was also diagnosed with IBS about 7 or so years ago.\\n\\nI was at university for digital media and I finished. My first year but  when the second year started my IBS symptoms got worse and I was I physically unable to go. thankfully the university gave me a year off and said I can start my second year next year after I get better. \\n\\nHowever it just seems to be getting worse not better. I can barely go outside without going through severe anxiety attacks which leads to horrible pains in my stomach for which I need to go home to go toilet for, when it was really bad I would feel very faint and start having panic attacks. \\nIt reached the point where I was practically housebound. I spent like 3 months playing games, watching anime and TV shows and the pains started to get a bit better.\\n\\nThen 2 days ago I went toilet and it happened again, severe pain, feeling very uneasy and then boom out of nowhere crippling depression, the waves just hit me.\\n\\nI began feeling hopeless again, I felt unsatisfied with life. Not just my life, but life in general. Thanks to my love of Anime, Webnovels, Games and Movies I started to wish my life was like that. I know it's childish, but deep down it's just how I felt. I couldn't accept reality, it was too mundane for me and I wasn't satisfied just sitting there everyday just watching or reading things. But I couldn't do anything about it because everytime I try to do something my IBS kicks in and basically cripples me. And I know that even if I try and do something, it's not really what I want. I don't want my life to be normal. All I would really be doing is trying to avoid the pain that it will never happen. \\n\\nI know this is long and it might be hard to emphasize with me if you don't really understand it. But I just felt like I really wanted to say something and see if maybe there were other people like me. I guess you could say I'm looking for friends who can understand me, I'm hoping that maybe it will make living a little easier if I have people to talk about the things I love with who also understand what it's like going through depression. \\n\\nThat's the conclusion I came up with anyway\\n\\nThanks for reading\", 'Getting motivated to get help\\nI was diagnosed with a mood disorder and PTSD ~1.5 years ago. I was getting help for a while but I dropped out of school and moved out of state so I just haven\\'t been able to do that in the past year. I live with (and mooch off of) an SO but I\\'ve been fairly isolated for about 6 months. I\\'ve been doing online school but had to drop my classes this semester when I started working. Now all I do is this stupid part-time job. I should probably quit because it makes me incredibly suicidal. It\\'s all so superficial. It doesn\\'t feel beneath me but I really just don\\'t mesh with it. \\n\\nAnyway. Health insurance. I can\\'t figure out how to fill out the income stuff. A hospital near me has people that can help but I just can\\'t find the motivation to even call them. It\\'s like I\\'m trying to prevent myself from getting help. It\\'s not even just psychiatric reasons that I want health insurance. I have a referral for a neurologist. I\\'ve been having memory issues, twitches, etc. I know I won\\'t go without insurance. I probably could stand to get on birth control and check out some other persistent problems too but a) I know I won\\'t be taken seriously and b) the only thing I genuinely like about myself is my mind so that\\'s the priority.\\n\\nI\\'m not completely not trying. I\\'ll take St. John\\'s Wort if I\\'m persistently suicidal but it doesn\\'t help with motivation. I\\'ve been going to support groups. I\\'ll \"decide\" to be motivated but end up collapsed and sobbing before I get out of the door. Play music, leave my phone behind so I don\\'t get sidetracked. Tell people what I\\'m doing so I feel pressured to keep my word. Incentivize with promises of fast food, caffeine, or chocolate. I dunno what else to do. I can\\'t even tell if it\\'s laziness or depression or something else. The only thing that motivates me to go to work is fear which is also the main thing that prevents me from quitting.', \"Nothing.\\nI just don't want to do anything. Nothing is the only thing that ever sounds good anymore. The stuff I study in school is really cool, but when I get home I just want to lay down and do nothing. Smoking weed makes it easier but I know I'm just pushing my feelings away.\\n\\nI'm just... Tired. And I feel like a bitch because of it. I go to school, work on some homework, go to work, procrastinate homework to get some damn relaxation time, rinse, repeat.\\n\\nI wish I could stop working and just focus on school, cuz it genuinely makes me happy as long as I can dedicate the time to it. But after working I just wanna do nothing. And if I work less hours I just get stressed about paying rent.\\n\\nI don't know if I hate myself or this economy more, but I just wish I could go far away sometimes. Just leave everyone behind and find somewhere to sit and do nothing. Listen to a waterfall crash in the forest, or just look up at a sky that isn't polluted to hell with light.\\n\\nI've been so good lately; Been through this long enough I know why I'm like this. It's February. And February always sucks. \", \"I am so fucking unbearably lonely\\nI have no job, no friends. and nothing even close to an SO. I've never even been on a date. That's a pipe dream of course I wouldn't date someone as disgusting as me so why should anyone else in the first place. But I can't stop desperately wanting to be loved, to be touched. not even sexually necessarily tho that too, but just be held, kissed. Anyone, I don't give a fuck anymore boy or girl just someone anyone please It's never happened and it feels like it never will. I feel like I'm starving to death. I can't shake this need I've never really felt before and it's every damn minute. it's so damn funny though I shrink away from even the slightest of contact with another human, in the rare occasion I'm in public I bury myself in my phone and hope desperately no one acknowledges me. no one ever does but I'm always still afraid they will. how fucking pathetic, isn't it. add this to the list of things that make me wanna rip my skin open\", 'I always feel like I will never achieve my dreams and I am a failure.\\nI have a big dream where I want to help people in those poor countries and volunteer in charity works. The issue that really concern me at the moment is child labor. I hate to see children working to earn money and live in poverty when they are supposed to learn and enjoy their childhood. \\n\\nAnother dream of mine is to pursue in the post graduate program after finish my degree. That is very difficult for me as I need a good GPA to get the financial loan. I think I didnt do well in my study at the moment. I dont think I am able to continue my study in master program. \\n\\nI always hate myself because I feel like I lack a lot of thing. I have a social anxiety where I love being alone, I feel nervous when talking with someone else. I avoided my highschool friends because I think I cant fit well. I am afraid to talk in front of the crowd, I am not able to express myself well. I hate that I am incapable to defend myself sometimes. I feel self loathing. I wake up every morning feeling the same thing, feel I will never accomplish anything. I see some of my friends are married, have their own cars and good jobs. I am stuck here and doing nothing. I cant be pretty like them and I dont have money. That is it my life.

However, even though everything is going great I'm still sad every day, and spend a lot of time thinking about how to kill myself.\\nNo one notices that I'm sad, and everyone thinks I must be really happy about how everything is going, and it just makes me feel worse that I can't be happy even when I have everything: every victory is hollow and ever action feels pointless.\\n\\nI don't even know who to talk to about this because I don't want to bother anyone, people have enough to worry about without me involving them in my problems, especially small ones like my feelings.\", \"Fuck Everything &amp; Everyone\\nI decided to make a different account for this, because I need to get all of this off my chest.

I might as well be, considering everything I have to do.\\n\\nI turned 17 a few months ago, and things have only gotten worse. My parents are completely delusional and can't grasp the fact that thet cause suffering for their own benefit. They would punch you in the face and find any excuse in the book to give a reason behind what they did, even if there wasn't one.\\n\\nMy mom is an asshole, to put it nicely. She's very controlling. I've called and made my own therapy appointments only to find out she cancelled them, resulting in me having to find a different therapist AND doctor twice because they wouldn't take me because of canceling so many times, and I still haven't found either, so no therapy or medication. I have next to no friends because of how she is, coupled with my inability to speak without getting anxiety. \\n\\nMy dad is a lazy dirtbag who fights with me constantly for no reason other than he hates me. He hates how liberal I am, he hates the people I like, whatever I like he probably hates. He sits in front of a TV all day watching shit, he bitches about anything he can, yet does absolutely nothing to fix the issue that he's the main cause of. No clean dishes? I'm in the wrong even though he doesn't rinse his or even bring them to the sink. Pills went missing? He takes more than he's supposed to and forgets and goes into a rage. So on and so forth.\\n\\nI honestly don't look forward to waking up anymore. I can only find peace at night and then I usually get less sleep than I should. Of course I'm 'lazy' for sleeping in. More gets done quicker in less time when I get up than the whole time they've been up.\\n\\nI hate this stupid town and I hate my life. It feels like I'm destined for absolute failure. School puts a heavy amount of pressure on me too. I wish I could go to sleep and not wake up, that would be ideal honestly.\\n\\nThe list of things that make me happy and want to live grows shorter every day, and I'm so, so lost on what to do anymore. I feel so uncomfortable and just... wrong. Like I know something bad is bound to happen. \\n\\nIdk, I'm just confused and scared.\", \"Aha! moment during therapy\\nSo I've been meeting with a therapist about once a week since October of 2017. It's been really great, and has helped pull me from the brink more than once. \\n\\nBackground: I'm gay, and was raised Catholic in the 90s. Guess what happened next! \\n\\nSpoiler: I was bullied mercilessly. If I wasn't too gay, I was too fat, or too tall, or too weird or too unpopular. You get the gist. It it wasn't my hair, it was my mannerisms; if it wasn't my high voice, it was the dark circles under my eyes. (Gee, what could have caused me to be losing sleep?)\\n\\nFlash forward to today: \\nMy therapist guided me through a meditation today that instructed me to visualize and speak to a younger version of myself. I described what I looked like, what characteristics defined me, and how I saw myself. Then I was instructed to, as myself as the adult I've become, speak to that child and tell him what I was feeling. \\n\\nI spoke with kindness and compassion and love and respect for that child, and told him everything would be alright. I told him that all of that hatred was wrong, that it was incorrect and that those people who say all those nasty hurtful things, they probably aren't even going to remember saying it, so don't waste your time holding onto it. \\n\\nAnd it got me thinking about all of the baggage I've he'd onto my life. All the glances and side comments and nasty, hateful things. And how I've internalized it, and believed it. \\n\\nAnd that's when the Aha! moment came. \\n\\n*All this time, I've been so worried about all the bullying that other people did, I wasn't even thinking about all the bullying I did to myself.* https://media.giphy.com/media/12KiGLydHEdak8/giphy.gif\\n\\nAll this time, *it was me.* Sure, it was other people who planted those seeds, but it was me who perpetuated it, who told myself that they were true. After all, if you say something enough, it might as well be as true as anything else.\\n\\n\\nSo there it is. There's one step. It might just be one step, but it's a step in the right direction. There's my holy shit moment of the day, and I just wanted to share with you all. There is hope. There is progress. There is love.

I barely even understand the language. My GPA is horrible. And I can't change schools for at least another 2 years due to family. I can't even get a job because my town has almost none, and the ones it does have are given to the natives (I'm foreign).

Not to say that I'm ashamed of it, but just because I never felt I had anyone to share with. I never have felt like I was able to confide in my close friends or family because I don't want them to carry the burden of my troubles, and I used to feel like it would just be a form of attention seeking to try and explain to others how I feel sometimes.\\n\\n\\n\\nWith that being said, I feel as if I truly hit my lowest of lows about an hour ago and the sad thing is that I cannot really describe the feeling... because all it felt like was just a severe sense of nothingness. I felt as if I was experiencing an out of body sensation, and my mind could not calculate any sense of emotion besides this feeling of dread that was accompanied by a warmth-like feeling starting from the back of my brain and slowly taking over my head.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt's been happening a lot lately during the night... especially since I've been moderately sick lately and it feels like my body is giving up on me no matter what I try... eating healthy and exercising only takes away the feelings of loneliness and sickness a little bit. What really helps is interaction with others, whether it be watching live programs or being on xbox talking to people or being in chat rooms because it gives me a small sense of community and belonging that I lose when my mind is left alone to itself.\\n\\n\\n\\n I know it sounds stupid, but lately I've just been envisioning my feelings as the mind flayer monster from Stranger Things because it helps me make a little more sense of everything to a degree when I envision the feelings as something physical...

Itâ\\x80\\x99s hard to find the words that can sum it all up in order to save some time and space within this letter. This letter is also not about those specific events but about you and only you, and how far youâ\\x80\\x99ve come; it all plays into being able to deal with whatever the future may bring. \\n\\nAs you admitted this morning, to yourself and G, your sense of clarity evaporates when you begin to feel vulnerable. It leads you to a self-fulfilling prophecy - the exact neediness you exhibit will do the exact opposite of what youâ\\x80\\x99d like it to do and will therefore lead you to feeling ever more â\\x80\\x9cneedy.â\\x80\\x9d \\n\\nListen to me: You are not validated by someoneâ\\x80\\x99s ability (or lack thereof) to love you. \\n\\nAnd again: Sometimes, it is not simply not about you. \\n\\nSo far in your healing process youâ\\x80\\x99ve managed to understand the importance of detachment. Youâ\\x80\\x99re making wonderful progress and I hope that at some point you are still progressing. Your existence is for you and for you only. It is not okay or healthy to live solely for another human being. Remember that you are not â\\x80\\x9cincompleteâ\\x80\\x9d without someone however that someone can enhance the you that you already are. A relationship consists of two people working together as a whole yet existing as their own sense of â\\x80\\x9cwholenessâ\\x80\\x9d outside of the relationship. That is so very important for you to remember for the rest of your life. Remember when you felt vulnerable just a few weeks ago (sometime in November) and wanted to dive into texting that boy in order to make you feel better about yourself? And then remember that you didnâ\\x80\\x99t because you kept your clarity and understood that it was a coping mechanism. Donâ\\x80\\x99t forget that youâ\\x80\\x99ve done that not only once but a few times now and that is exceptional. I understand future Bri may encounter some setbacks and that her well-being might as well be a roulette wheel, but thatâ\\x80\\x99s exactly what this letter is for. \\n\\nAs youâ\\x80\\x99ve been told, you are luminous. You shine bright. Your heart is [almost too] huge. You have the potential to do great things. You are not your illness and you are not your insecurities. The grave you will lay in one day will only consist of you and nobody else. If the world ends and you survive, you have yourself. You have to keep this mind every single day. Work on self love and understand your worth. Yes, G makes you feel like the most important girl in the world. But before you can let him do that, you need to understand that you are the most important girl in the world to yourself, for yourself. \\n\\nYouâ\\x80\\x99re done putting your interests aside just to receive love for the night/day. Youâ\\x80\\x99re done with getting angry at the phone for not getting responses quickly. Youâ\\x80\\x99re done feeling unimportant or unloved because youâ\\x80\\x99re not someoneâ\\x80\\x99s first priority. In the month and a half since the breakup, you have transformed.

She needs to know that even though she may not be at a point in life she envisioned, she did something for herself. \\n\\nWhen you feel like heâ\\x80\\x99s pulling away, donâ\\x80\\x99t push harder. \\n\\nWhen you feel like you want to run to him in order to silence your overwhelmingly surfacing insecurities, understand that will not make things better. Understand that they are amplified and you are only expressing coping mechanisms in order to deal with the underlying issue. The issue isnâ\\x80\\x99t that he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t love you but that you make yourself unloveable. Understand that when you get into that mindset and lose grasp of the clarity, someone moving mountains for you will not fill that hole of pain. The only person on the face of this Earth that can fill that hole is you. You have the capability of moving mountains on your own when you remember these things. \\n\\nContinue doing your research. Continue taking time for yourself. Continue setting your phone down for hours at a time. Continue living your life out and letting others play a part and not the center role. Youâ\\x80\\x99re the star of your life, you lead the show. Your family, friends, boyfriend, colleagues - they play their roles in your story. Most importantly, they play their lead role in their own stories and similarly you are character. \\n\\nLearn to appreciate silence. Learn to appreciate a bit of loneliness and solitude. Self-love includes coming home from work to take a hot bath and drink a glass of red wine, not rushing over to whoevers house in order to feel loved by someone else. \\n\\nYou cannot be loved appropriately if you cannot love yourself first.  \\n\\nIsnâ\\x80\\x99t it just like me to start taking the advice Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been given by so many people my entire life. \\n\\nLove yourself.\\nRespect yourself.\\nAppreciate your own time.\\nRespect others.\\nRespect otherâ\\x80\\x99s need for space. \\nLive for you.\\nAgain, love yourself. \\n\\n\\nWith love,\\nB, 12/3/2017.\\n', 'i\\nThanks to anyone who read this.\\n\\nI can\\'t feel any emotion: happiness, sadness, anger, nothing at all.

I just needed to say this somewhere.\\n\\nAfter recently getting out of the hospital for a(nother) attempt at my life, I was surrounded by family and friends who want to support me. For a couple days this almost gave me a high, thinking that maybe I really am glad I wasn't able to go through with it or that maybe I was beating these years of depressiveness. Not even just after a week of getting out of the mental ward, I fantasize about what I could have done differently to have made sure I died that night.

I was so distraught and caught up in sadness and self-hatred that I, wanting to distance myself from the situation, not just leaving it alone, told her I wanted to break up with her out of sheer emotional irrationality. It turns out I was sadder without her, and she reached out to me to talk soon later. We got back together, and she said she was okay. The way she described the whole situation let me know she understood my plight completely, but I ruined her that day and she\\'s been off ever since.

I tried to get time off, but they didn\\'t offer bereavement for people who weren\\'t immediate family.\\n\\nI was so distraught that I couldn\\'t go to the funeral. I was afraid to see his body.

I'm on mobile so pardon my typos which will happen. I'd like to take this time to thank anyone who reads this as well as giving a shout out to anyone currently struggling with depression. I have a long history with Type 1 Bipolar Disorder. Although that isn't necessarily depression in itself patients who are Bipolar are bound to eventually oscillate into that emotional polarity.\\n\\n\\nTo give a quick summary here is what happened to me: I grew up incredibly wealthy. My Father was an ex alcoholic. My Mother died when I was 13 and my Father went back to drinking to cope with the loss of his wife (my Mother). My Father became suicidal and threw everything we had away. We went bankrupt and I went to live with my Brother across the country.\\n\\n\\nMy Brothers wife left him shortly after I moved in. He became suicidal as well, ended up hospitalized. I moved back across the country again to live with my then pseudo homeless Father.\\n\\n\\nOne day my Father shows up to my school drunk, gets arrested, I am taken in by the state and put into foster care. I end up living with an incredibly poor hispanic family and eat almost nothing everyday. I have no bed. I sleep on the floor. \\n\\n\\nThe state then places me in an incredibly religious home where i essentially become a slave and i cook and clean nonstop for an extremely wealthy catholic couple. They don't like me Because I liked hard rock. \\n\\n\\nMy third stay I end up living in a small apartment with a woman who was good at hiding her side prostitution gig and methamphetamine addiction.\\n\\n\\nAfter all the years my Father gets his life back under control. He begins dating a wealthy woman who isn't a fan of me. He takes prolonged stays at her home about 40 miles away. He would visit the house to restock it with food, pay the bills, then leave again. During this time i saw my Father maybe 15 times a year. Each encounter was brief and lasted less than 30 minutes.\\n\\n\\nDuring this I still went to school, cooked, did my laundry, and did kind of normal kid stuff.\\n\\n\\nThe point of this story is I am an adult now who is married. I am a software engineer. I am financially stable. Regardless of how dark it gets it is possible to make it out on top. You have to focus and be strong. Do whatever you need to do to survive.\\n\\n\\nIf anyone has any questions or would like to chat, need advice, whatever please let me know. I currently do volunteer work to aid people who suffer from Bipolar Disorder as well as others like ADHD or OCD. I also, accidentally, mentor Fatherless children on Xbox Live (strange, I know).\\n\\n\\nIts not easy out there and world and parents sometimes forget how hard it is being a teen. No judgement.

So she just took the stuff and started wearing the clothes. None of that is true. What's probably going on here is that she's buying herself things, and using me as a scapegoat so she doesn't have to tell her boyfriend she has money, or bought things for herself. Or she's just delusional and making shit up. Maybe even that she's stealing clothes from me and covering that way. I could believe any of that. Either way, she wants me to leave, and I know she does. And that hurts like a mother. No pun intended. What I want to do is get custody of my younger brother, and leave the state. Just start over, and make sure my brother is raised in a safe and nurturing environment.

While sobbing with my hands in my face, trying to figure out who would take care of my son and my unpaid debt, I looked up to see my cat staring at me. She has this stern, mothering expression in her eyes, and we locked eyes for the longest time. She kept my gaze until my sobbing was under control and I really thought about my actions. Maybe she just wanted wet food.\\n\\n\\nI am really bad at remembering to take my meds, and usually the day or two where I forget doesn't have this effect on me, but for the pile of emotional shit dealt to me the last week or so, apparently it did. I haven't felt suicidal in years and I just need someone to understand where I'm coming from. \", 'My story, i have to get this off my chest. Life sucks\\nHello everyone,\\n\\nThis is a post about my life basically, i just need to get this off my chest. Its a long post but i just have to do this.\\n\\nLet me introduce myself first. Currently im a 19yo boy who turns 20 in March, I live in Belgium (grammar will be bad sorry). \\nI have 1 older brother,  2 loving parents who are still together. And oh yeahh i have a very cute pupper as well. Financially everything is fine. \\nBasically a family some people only can dream for. I mainly play on nintendo consoles (switch, 3ds, gba, n64) and the MMORPG runescape (dont laugh :))\\nI consider myself a extravert to my friends but an introvert when im talking to girls (lol) or strangers.\\n\\nI\\'ve always had a rough time fitting at school. Our elementary school was VERY SMALL, it only had 75 kids (including kindergarden). I was always the \"odd one out\", but because it was so small i had 1 friend. We played alot together and it was a ok time really. but when i was 5 most people around me started to notice that i made weird random noises. And that i made small movements with my shoulders (unnatural ones). Friends got annoyed, parents got annoyed, everyone got annoyed. Eventually my teacher screamed at me telling me to shut up, RIP ME. \\nEventually mom took me to a specialist and it turned out i have Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, if you youtube this you will get extreme cases where people shout fuck and ass, and move uncontrollably all over the place. THIS IS NOT THE CASE WITH ME. I think Tourette affected my life ALOT (it still does!!). I was always a really shy kid until i was 11, i started to accept my tourettes and was a happy 11yo.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n**HIGH SCHOOL** (from 12 to 18yo, its devided in 6 \"classes\". \\nThis is where the problems started, when i just started high school i was scared but excited like everyone. Unfortunately for me i got the SHITTIEST bullies in my class. I had no friends in year 1, they made fun of me becuz of my tourettes (i didnt tell them becuz they wouldnt understand). It got to a point where i just smacked someone on the head with a baseball bat. Teachers knew of my situation so we both got 1 week detention. I was \"depressed\" during that year, you know the teenage life, its hard. Year 2 they changed me to another class and they were OK. They didnt bully me but they didnt talk to me either. They just left me alone really, during those 2 years i had 1 friend who i talked with but he also had his own friends. So most of the time i was alone.\\nBut that friend had no common interests, so i ended up playing runescape all day, u can talk with other players there and i had plenty of friends in there. It felt awesome to have friends and i spent all my time there neglecting my studies. But somehow i passed  the first 2 years lol.\\n\\nI thought year 1 was bad, but then i met year 3 (different school). I got bullied even more in this class, they called me names, ignored me, humiliated me in class and started bitching if they had to sit next to me. Luckily they never got fysical with me (idk if thats the right word). In the middle of that year I decided \\n in the middle of the fucking winter (it was snowing) in morning to take the bus (mom was always home and it was near our house) and to step of early. Spent 2 hours in a small freezing cold chapel playing on my nintendo 3ds, go to my house after mom left and spend playing games in my room. \\nAfter 3 days the school called, my mom found out. I was stuck and told her everything about the bullying, about me feeling like absolute shit and that i had no motivation to go to school. She let the teachers know, went to school, got me to a psychiatrist. The bullying stopped, but they still ignored me, i still hadnt any friends and i still didnt feel any better. I somehow survived the 4 next months and passed. If i had 1.1% lower in total i would have failed that year. \\nThe only way i felt better was with playing runescape.\\n\\nYEAR 4-6 IS IN THE SAME CLASS WITH THE SAME PEOPLE, in year 5 three people joined\\nYear 4 kinda went the same as year 2 believe it or not. The classmates were ok, they didnt bully me, they talked to me when needed but that was it. I spent my time with some kids i met on the playground. But u know they were those kind of friends u just spent time with becuz nobody else is around. They never invited me to go to parties or to hang around or anything. This year was also the 1st year i told them about my Tourette Syndrome ( i got some damn weird looks at times and i didnt even realize i was making sounds). They understood, they acted more nice to me, i didnt feel left out so much but was still unhappy.\\nAnd on runescape i got into a community (clan), made some good friends there. It was the only place in the word i was truly happy. \\n\\nYear 5, same class as last year. 3 people joined and 1 of them became a friend of mine. To be completely honest he is still one of my best friends today, but i come back to that later. Lets call him J, Ok so now i had a friend. We had a small group of 3 people now, S (other classmate who was nice to me), J and me. 2 others from another class joined the group somehow and i finally made some friends. We started going to parties and they invited me. Unlucky for me they dont play runescape and have different interests in gaming, thanks to this im not that close to them. But i was finally starting to be happy becuz i had friends. \\nAll the small things that bothered me (sitting alone, always last chosen at sports etc etc...), bothered me alot less becuz i was super happy i finally found something positive in my life. I survived year 5 and 6 fairly positive compared to year 1 and 3. We all graduated and college time arrived\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n**COLLEGE**\\nThis was last year, so this is super recent. I decided to study \"orthopedagogie\", it doesnt have an english translation. Its working with mentally disabled people or troubled young people, stuff like that.\\nOfcourse I begged my parents for a student room, i wanted to have a great college life like in the movies! Everyone says its the best time of your life and you should enjoy it to the fullest. Oh boy i was so so dumb for believing it would be that easy. And ofcourse i also joined a society. Finally growing up like an adult and living alone, I WAS FREEEEEEEEEEE.\\nIn my class i got along with most of them, we had some good laughs during breaks, went to our class etc... but i was the only one who had a student room (unlucky). So ye that was that. In my society i tried making friends, but it didnt work out really. I missed some first important parties becuz i decided to go with some classmates (i still think to this day that this was a huge mistake), when i went to parties alone to make friends  (because i realized my class was lame) they already a \"friend group\". I didnt know (and still dont) how to make contact with them and make friends.\\n\\nI was really really really lonely last year, i just spent all my time playing runescape, talking with my online friends. November 2016 i met someone and we became super super super super close. (he is american, not lovers just friends). We still talk to each other everyday. Man we even were planning to go to japan together but my mom wont let me. But coming back to that later.\\nDuring the weekends i had my old friend group from highschool, we still hang out 2x per month, we still do. But they mostly spent time studying and hanging out with their uni friends. They didnt left me out or anything but i had lost alot of contact with them. I failed 50% of my courses, i decided to call it quits. I was happy that i could finally leave that student room. uni year 1 was HORRIBLE.\\n\\nI liked the study i was doing, so i decided to try it again but in a lower degree, its in a school for adults (18+). Its hard to explain but basically i ended up with 60% out of 20 people to be 30+ and have kids. It was class 1x a week and internship (idk if thats the right word) 2.5 days per week. I was working with adults who had a mental disability. Last year i never had internship, only class. It turns out that Orthopedagogie is not the study for me. I dont want to do this the rest of my life. I had officially quit november 2017. \\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWe finally arrived to the present time, thank you for the people that made it here. \\n\\nSo here i am, a 19 year old boy (almost 20), wasted 1.5 years in uni, wasting parents money... I have no idea what i want to study next... The only study i consider doing is social work, luckily for me u can start in february. So i have to do some shitty job from november - february.\\nI still have my highschool friends who i hang out with 2x per month? I have a loving brother and parents, good financial situation. I can earn some quick cash for 3 months and go back to study. But to be completely honest... I DONT SEE THE FUCKING POINT.\\n\\nMy whole life i have felt lonely, sometimes with a good reason, sometimes really without a reason. I have dealt with \"depression\" (not officially diagnosed), or atleast felt like i was. \\nTo be completelty honest. I feel like a sad little fucking sack of shit. What have i achieved in my life? Fucking nothing. I cant even think like a fucking normal person, people think im weird, i dont have logical sense. Everyday i have to force myself out of bed. Its been like this for so long now that im starting to get used to it. Even now that i dont have a job until feb, i simply dont have the strength to get out of bed. I sleep 12 hrs per day just so the day passes by faster.\\n\\nI dont feel like going out, i dont feel like talking to people. Runescape was always my escape, but i simply do not have the motivation to even play runescape . On the outside i still act normal, i laugh and act like everything is fine so my parents wont worry. Whenever i have a job they fire me because \"i work to slow\". Once i worked in a storage for a store and had to get the order from customers. You have to use \"common sense\" all the time, and they said i didnt have that enough for this job. This happened 3x... \\n\\nRemember when i said that i have tourette syndrome, well i always told myself that it also does have a \"mental\" side to it. I can come across different then the \"normal person\", or use the wrong word in sentences to express myself. And i interpret things differently at times, i usually need to hear the explanation multiple times and they have to explain it very clearly. \\nMy parents just said im a slow learner but with \"hard work i get there\". This fucked me over so many times in life, and whenever i tell people/friends about the mental side of tourette they all have that expression on their face. The face of \"ohh that explains alot, but i also feel so sorry for you\". Im so fucking sick of it, im not even sure if this happens becuz of my tourette. Im really starting to think this is just all in my head and that im just retarded. (my iq is average tho). I often imagine myself having some disorder to make myself feel better, i really dont know what to do with myself.\\nI feel like an absolute loser who cant even think like a normal person. Last 6 months i bought myself a nintendo switch + some games to cheer myself up. it gets me trough some days but in the end i still end up having no energy to get out of bed.\\n\\nBUT i feel like an arrogant asshole writing this, i have nothing to complain about... Alot of people had the worst childhood, or had a traumatic experience... I have a family many people can only dream of? financially im good. I have the chance to try studying again.... I HAVE NO REASON TO FEEL THIS WAY AND IT MAKES ME GO INSANE. Im having alot of negative thoughts, and i cant get them out of my head. I dont see the light in the end of the tunnel. (Not stuff like suicide or self cutting btw). \\nAs i said earlier i met someone a year ago trough rs. I can always talk to him, i never met him in person but we discord at times and message each other everyday. I feel more connected to him than my IRL friends. They have no same interests, other life goals... How sad is that? Fkn someone i met online is my best friend? He is the only 1 that knows how i feel but he doesnt understand how i feel. He tries to support me, but it doesnt help.\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nIm not making this post so everyone feels bad for me.... Im just so sick of life... I dont know what to do... My parents have their own problems and think im over exaggerating...\\n\"Grow up son? Everyone has to get a job\" \"Grow up for once\". But they dont know what it feel like to drag yourself trough the whole day 24/7 (atleast i hope they dont). They think im just lazy and dont want to work... I feel isolated from the world and i cant get out of it.\\n\\nOk god damnit im re-reading this post, at this point im just rambling... Idk what i expect from posting this here... Maybe its just to give my empty brain a boost... \\nI will just end this post now or i keep adding stuff.\\n\\n\\nEDIT: i have no clue how to get the text all the same size\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'I canâ\\x80\\x99t decided if Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been managing or avoiding my mind and feelings...\\nHow is everyone today?

Or should I zip my lips and stop thinking about it :/ some perspective would be nice.', \"It feels as if I'm heading towards a dark place\\nHey, haven't been here before but I had a quick scroll and this feels like the right sub to vent to. I'm 18 from the UK, I've had a rough educational life (I alway talked, went in high with my friends, got in minor trouble that kinda thing). I fucked up college in the second year of my 2 year diploma course and got excluded for the same kind of shit previously mentioned but on a larger scale, this really fucked me up as I thought I'd end up doing nothing with my life when I really wanted to do something with it. 10 weeks ago I got a job and a paid for graduates course which pays out over Â£1100 per month after tax which is incredible for me, it's a job I love, work hard at and it's exactly the path I want to take in life career-wise. So I've been given a second start, I have money, great friends, a good social life and my life is on track but I still can't quite feel complete. I'm very social anxious and this affects my everyday life but I push through it, I have to. I smoke week almost everyday and I've been smoking for about 5 years now. The problem is, I still have a void that I can't fill and I can never really feel that happy by myself. I love my metal and I'm a huge music fan, I used to play a lot of games but I've stopped caring so much now. Sometimes I find it hard to enjoy things as much as I used to. I feel exhausted at home as I don't sleep much and the anxiety takes it out of me until I walk through the door. It feels as if it's getting worse and I don't know what to do and I don't even know why I feel this way. Sometimes it can get quite bad where I won't even feel like doing anything but pulling bongs with the TV on in the background as the day is just too much to handle sometimes. \\n\\nSry for the huge wall of text but I'm trying to get this typed quick as I'm about to go out. I don't even know why I'm posting this really, I want to vent, maybe I want advise. I don't know, the fact that I'm even posting this means it's starting to get to me in some way. \", 'Anhedonia.. anyone else experience it?\\nI just want to vent and have some insight. \\n\\nI never \"fall\" in love anymore. I\\'m lucky if I can even feel love. My current boyfriend is so supportive, but as the past few years of my life, just can\\'t fall in love. \\n\\nI don\\'t feel the own love or care for my family or friends. I don\\'t care if something happened to my friends, and I don\\'t care if I never see my loving, caring parents again for a long time, or ever. I don\\'t care to help friends or family with anything. \\n\\nI have no passions in life. I have no hobbies. I\\'m not passionate about my family, friends, work, school, boyfriend, hobbies, my Jeep, animals, etc.. NOTHING excites me, brings me happiness or joy or peace. OCD, anhedonia and depression control everything. \\n\\nThe only moments of Bliss I get are sometimes with my boyfriend, I get giddy about thinking about our future, or seeing a selfie he sent me while at work and make me swell. Those are occasional, but the only thing I ever feel that\\'s positive to a somewhat major degree. I think my new birth control (first time on it) has made my depression worse. I don\\'t believe in antidepressants for myself. I\\'ve been stressed out so much I\\'ve lost a bunch of weight too.\\n\\nNow that I\\'ve vented, I just don\\'t want to feel alone. I want this to go away. I want to be excited to see my boyfriend at the end of the day, and excited for the day I may marry him. I want to have a hobby I am passionate about. I want to go to work and be happy and thankful I have a job that I do. I want to feel love for my mom and dad. \\n\\nIs anyone else like me out there? Does it ever get better? ', 'Been depressed for so long that i cant remember the last time i was myself.\\nHey guys this is my first post here and i dont know where else to go. Ive been in a dark place for a long time but im the kind of person who channels this into humor so not even my family could tell. I just turned 20 yesterday and ive been depressed for about 2 years now. I havent opened up to anyone about it because i keep brushing it aside thinking it would pass but it just keeps getting worse. Today i realized something that made me genuinely cry, i seriously didnt remember the last time i was myself. I used to be super carefree and relaxed, i was full of energy and would answer any call to chill in seconds. I just asked my close friend when was the last time he remembers the real me and he said it was the beginning of college and im currently finishing my second year. Its been getting progressively worse in the last 6 months with a serious drop in my appetite.  I also started feeling anxiety for the first time in my life and suicidal thoughts are uncommon Ive lost about 10 pounds in 2 months because of this. My grades also took a hard hit, going from a 3.0 gpa every semester to a 1.7. I just had a talk with my mom and she told me that im being ungrateful and that i need to get my shit together (ironic considering she suffered depression for years until i pushed her to divorce my father).  Im not blaming her at all for my situation because she was raised by two hardasses so i understand why its hard for her to understand why a teen would be depressed. I know that life is worth it and it gets better but i really cant keep the darkness out of my head. Weed has kept me sane for a while but quitting recently caused it to come back full force and i really need advice on how to get back on track.

Anyways, I'm a chill dude, good looking, and sociable. Anyways, I have trouble making any fucking friends with dudes my age (no trouble with girls). I'll vibe with them really well at first and play sports or whatever with a few of them. They seem pretty friendly but at the same time some of their other friends seem to kind of hate me even though they act polite when interacting with me. I can even hear them talk shit sometimes from a distance even tho there's no personal beef and most of them haven't spoken more than a sentence to me b4? however they won't directly confront me and at least be upfront.

I\\'m gay and I\\'ve been with my boyfriend J for five months.\\n\\nI used to be severely depressed. But lately my life has been pretty good. But sometimes I get into a depressed mood and I start having doubts about my relationship.\\n\\nHonestly nothing is really wrong between us. But sometimes I feel like I don\\'t really love him, and that we don\\'t actually have any chemistry. And I don\\'t know why I feel that way. I start nitpicking our relationship and try to find flaws in it to justify how I feel.\\n\\nBut other times we\\'ll both be in a good mood, and the spark is totally there, and I feel great about everything.\\n\\nI\\'m starting to think that this is just what my brain defaults to when I\\'m sad, and that there\\'s nothing actually wrong with us. For example this weekend I was feeling great, then on Sunday my parents had a conversation with me that really triggered me, and now I\\'m feeling depressed and doubting my relationship. (The conversation with my parents had nothing to do with my boyfriend.)\\n\\nBasically it seems like whenever I feel down, my brain immediately jumps to \"maybe I should break up with my boyfriend.\" I don\\'t know if this is a sign that something is actually wrong, or if this is just what a depressed brain does. \\n\\nDoes anyone else experience this? Is this common? ', \"Failure to trust â\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x99those on my sideâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x99. [possible trigger Warning]\\nI find myself incapable of trusting my spouse. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been with my SO for nearly 15 years, 7 married this year, we have 3 children. Before I hit my mid-teens Iâ\\x80\\x99d been through nearly a decade of sexual abuse within the already dysfunctional household I grew up one, with an alcoholic father and a narcissistic mother.\\n\\nI met my now spouse when I was 17. He had been in a two year relationship with a girl a few years his senior, which left him broken after her infidelity. And Iâ\\x80¦ well I lived day to day, carrying what I could. Iâ\\x80\\x99ll never forgot how I coldly and factually told him with a mere two sentences what I had to endure, telling him that if he did chose me, he would be settling for a lifetime shared with a woman with severe ups and downs due to her limited mental strength. He convinced me to go for it and I wept in his arms. That was probably the first time in my life someone did not look the other way and I allowed myself to be vulnerable, instead of distant and cold. I opened myself up to him.\\n\\nFew years later my home situation imploded. I ran. His mother took me under her wing, I think she was the first parental figure I could lean on in my life. His father loathed me as the girl from the slums, threatening me in private to never marry his son. Reminding me of my lowly descent when he could. He would never come to accept me fully but at least fully respects me in public, which to me is commendable enough.\\n\\nAfterwards I started living with my now SO, still during our teens in a studio. The idea was triggered and pushed for by me as a solution after a bout of infidelity on his side after he moved to study in a city a couple hours away. He partook in intimate relations with a girl he knew from another country over webcam due to â\\x80\\x98â\\x80\\x99lonelinessâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x99 and held the act in the same regards as watching porn whereas I didnâ\\x80\\x99t. We tried to work things out.\\n\\nAs we did my view of him started to crumble, but was rebuilt after living together surprisingly worked remarkably well. We grew more towards each other and were best friends on top of lovers. In between this life changing chapter and where I am now, he has had a few strikes I simply can not forget. While I was once open to share my ups and downs and sadness with him, now Iâ\\x80\\x99d rather not. Because where I once trusted him to hold me, I now trust him to ridicule me and tell me to man the fuck up. And the stubborn ass I am, I do, but this comes with resentment. But to explain the strikes:\\n\\n- One is where I was crying after having particularly bad and involuntary memories. Annoyed by my state and stressed by upcoming finals he asked me: When is this going to end? Youâ\\x80\\x99re always spinning the same old tales, youâ\\x80\\x99re driving yourself insane.\\n\\n- Another was when he screamed out while we had visitors: How would you like it if I told everyone you were raped? He believed I had done something utterly despicable, blame was pinned upon me by one of his siblings. In that moment something broke, the attack was 100% unwarranted. So much trust lost. When he figured out I had done nothing to him the apologies came swift and numerous.\\n\\n- One was when I asked him for a letter. He will always buy flowers on special occasions, which I hate. They wither and die. I just hate the sentiment, I dislike it and I have communicated this. I wanted something which lasts. A reminder. All I wanted was a letter. Years I secretly yearned for one but received flowers instead, which I still tended to. Finallyâ\\x80¦ I asked for a letter. He refused and told me point blank to my face he would not. That it was silly I needed something to hold onto, and that this item would become something of an unhealthy obsession.\\n\\n- The latest strike was after I endured a panic attack while I was on my own, which I managed myself before he returned home. He was upset when I confided in him and he stated: I will not be on your side if you are mentally ill. I will choose our children and make sure they grow up with stability. (Later he corrected himself and stated that if I was to turn schizophrenic or manic, he would have me committed and divorce me, but would support me through depression and anxiety).\\n\\nNow to me a panic attack is something manageable if you are equipped to deal with it. Through the years I have learned to be aware of my surroundings and triggers and to be prepared to deal with anything since I am responsible for my children. I have no history of hysterical or erratic behavior, so I found his reaction to my first ever panic attack veryâ\\x80¦ crude.\\n\\nI have my pride even through my depression for what I have survived and what I have accomplished. But I hate that I can not find it in myself again to open up towards my spouse and more than often find myself crying when I am capable to, so I can put up my smile and brave face when I NEED to. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve successfully faked it till I made it. And of the 15 years that we have been together the good by far outweighs the bad, something which can not be conveyed well enough in this post. But what has been said can be never taken back. Even though recently he said: Don't you understand after 15 years I am on your side? \\n\\nI understand. I hate that I canâ\\x80\\x99t be vulnerable anymore. I hate that the trust is gone, and the resentment grows. If anyone has advice or a similar story of lost trust, Iâ\\x80\\x99d just love to hear and talk about it, if only to gain some perspective.\\n\\nEdit: formatting\", 'My parents only having expectations for me to succeed just makes me feel like the biggest failure of my brothers.\\nWhich not only is bullshit but also makes me just not try in the first place a lot of the time.

Iâ\\x80\\x99ve lost all motivations and my passion for arts (Iâ\\x80\\x99m an art student), failed my thesis which sent me into another dark place, â\\x80\\x99friendsâ\\x80\\x99 were not even there to help me get up, and for the remaining years I had in college, the thing that kept me going are my parents, I just wanted to survive for them. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve lost all emotions, the flame that was once burning in my heart, the excitement I had when I was a freshman. I graduated college 7 months ago and found work not related to the course I took up, it felt really low, but I just wanted to survive. Training for work now, didnâ\\x80\\x99t want to make friends again, had one, but he didnâ\\x80\\x99t liked the people so he left in a few weeks, the only thing in my mind was to focus and be better for this job to survive. Avoided lunch and hanging out with workmates, and didnâ\\x80\\x99t really reveal much about myself aside from having a mundane life. The trainers were aware of my introversion and decided to have random sitting arrangements every week so we could get to know our workmates more, and I could get to talk about other stuff aside from work. 3 weeks in training and still, I didnâ\\x80\\x99t made any connections, I only help out my workmates professionally, point out mistakes and the next step they should take.\\n\\nI get to be sit mates with the liveliest girl in training, playful and have a contagious â\\x80\\x99happyâ\\x80\\x99 aura(?). There were also a few talks and laughs about work related stuff, but I didnâ\\x80\\x99t really made efforts to start it, she was always the one that engages first (and thatâ\\x80\\x99s because sheâ\\x80\\x99s an extrovert and does this to everyone anyways). Being around her, hearing her voice, seeing her smile felt something, it felt like the flame that I lost 4 years ago came back. But, what made me fell the most is that sheâ\\x80\\x99s intelligent as well and speaks in English flawlessly (I live in a country outside US). I can also relate to her because she suffers from clinical depression and requires therapy sessions every now and then (everyone in training knows this anyways because she told the class from the get-go). I didnâ\\x80\\x99t really asked her out for lunch or coffee, I really wanted to so I could get to know her better and be friends with her, be her guide in her darkest days, but my introversion and over thinking always gets the best of me.\\n\\nThere were only a few times she joined me and my friend during a coffee break where I found out a few things about her. There were times that I see the sadness beyond her smile, and times where her depression was clearly visible and affected me greatly. I always think about scenarios - if the conditions were right - where I get to talk with her and lend a helping hand, at the end of the day they only remain as thoughts. I know she doesnâ\\x80\\x99t think about me like how I think about her. Every time our shift ends, I leave the office quickly and ignore the feelings I have for her, my mind is at a constant battle on whether or not to ask her for lunch, ask her if sheâ\\x80\\x99s ok. Itâ\\x80\\x99s even worse at night, whenever I see her late night tweets about her depression, a part of me just wants to be there for her, and the other part gives me the realization of how pathetic I am and that I donâ\\x80\\x99t deserve her. I know that she had an ex-bf that broke her heart, and currently has a gf (sheâ\\x80\\x99s bi). Yet, she still gives me inspiration in every photo I take. I really donâ\\x80\\x99t know what is wrong with me, Iâ\\x80\\x99m being tormented by my own mind and I still like it. Knowing that she already has someone in her heart, yet still seeing her depressed at times (and looking at her tweets), really makes me want to step up and do something, but held back by my own tormented soul.\\n\\nNext week would be the last week in training, after that weâ\\x80\\x99re going to get split up into teams and do actual work, but still go back to class to share our experience and reflect upon them.

It consumes your mind almost every second of every day. \\n\\nI\\'m usually a positive person (at least I try to be). Grew up with this girl in the church. We were the best of friends.

I asked her out 3 times, once in middle school, once in freshman year, and once in senior year, all three times given the response \"I\\'m sorry, I don\\'t like you in that way.\"\\n\\nIt messed me up. Even affected my first two relationships. I got with my first girlfriend solely because she liked me. Part of me hoped my best friend would get jealous. I genuinely liked my second girlfriend and she liked me. This girl gave me the butterflies, but because neither of us made a real effort to be boyfriend and girlfriend, we didn\\'t last. Before, after, and sometimes during each of these relationships, I would wish it was my best friend (I know, a dick move). \\n\\nThen I messed up. I was influenced by a terrible person to say some things I shouldn\\'t have. We went to the same community college like we planned but three years passed without ever seeing each other because we were fighting.\\n\\nThe time that we spent apart allowed me to clear my head. Before, I used to think about her all the time. Now, days, even weeks would pass without her crossing my mind. I met plenty of people in college and made tons of good friends, focused on my hobbies, it was the happiest I\\'ve been. \\n\\nEventually, we got tired of fighting and I realized what it was that I fucked up: an extremely good friendship. After I made an effort to show how sorry I was, she made an effort to let me back into her life. Then I thought, \"Don\\'t fuck this up. She doesn\\'t need you to like her. She needs you to be a good friend.\" I said some harsh things, and because of it, we weren\\'t friends for 2 to 3 years. So naturally, we tried making up for the time we had lost. \\n\\nShe invited me to hang with her friends. I invited her to hang with mine.

I find it harder to come to terms with us never being together.

She has A LOT of guy friends that she\\'s close with, and a few girl friends that she\\'s really close with. And though it only bothered a little back then, it\\'s something I\\'m jealous of now.

Every day, I tell myself, I will eat healthy, I will make better decisions, I will not hate myself, I will not speak down to myself, etc... Each and every day, I fail. This kills me. \\n\\nMy second problem is that I have a well paying job but it is very stressful and demanding. It takes up the majority of my day and this stress feeds into my poor eating habits. I have considered quitting but I cannot justify saying no to the money. I am scared that if I quit to try to focus on myself, I will just eat more and more because I will be less busy. \\n\\nI am a lazy, unmotivated person who is notorious for making excuses for herself. I really need some guidance. I hate waking up. I hate getting out of bed. I do not even want to shower or function. I don't know what to do. \", \"Am I crazy for wanting to get back with her?\\nSo let me give you guys a bit of a timeline first: \\n\\n- April 2017 we met at work, became really good friends. She still had a boyfriend, but broke up with him about 2 weeks after we started hanging out. \\n\\n- June 2017 I told her I liked her as more than a friend, she didn't feel this way towards me at the time. \\n\\n- July 2017 she started dating a guy she already knew, we'll call him Jake. \\n\\n- August 2017 she broke up with Jake. Jake made her feel terrible for it and cut her off completely, leaving her to say that she hated him and wanted no part of him.\\n\\n- September/October 2017 she told me she's always been attracted to me, but wasn't ready for a relationship. I was in love with her at this time, after knowing her for a while and her being everything I want in someone. Suggested being FWB, which I took her up on. But whenever I tried to make a move on it, she didn't seem to want to do anything. We hung out just us 2 every day, would always be talking, but for some reason when the time came around to make a move she never seemed to want to do anything. \\n\\nMid October 2017 she said how we would be better off being friends since we didn't seem to be going anywhere and that it was hurting her self esteem, and that she started talking to Jake again. She is currently still dating Jake, but from what I hear from her are on the verge of another breakup.\\n\\nAnd now I want her more than ever. I was absolutely heartbroken when she cut things off with me, and I'm still not over her. And she knows this. If she cuts things off with Jake, I don't know what to do. I want her back more than anything, but at the same time it's like she put me through such pain and I don't want to chance that happening again. She is everything that I could possibly want in a girl, and I can't imagine myself without her. And we're still friends, which probably isn't helping to be honest. But she's still my best friend. Am I crazy for feeling this way? \", 'Whenever I try to change my life these thoughts pop up\\nHad depression and anxiety for years and have many times tried to make changes to my life.

I thought I was in a good enough place (not financially though, obviously) that I didnt even need Lexapro anymore so I started using my remaining bottle and taking smaller doses every day.

One thing leads to another and I am diagnosed with depression and put on a dose of escitalopram (generic form of Lexapro) 20mg a day. Have a history of depression on my mother's side, and they had all the symptoms pretty severely minus the suicidal ideation, which I believed supported their diagnosis.\\n\\nSo as school was finishing up and I had exams to study for, I spent most afternoons essentially consciously unconscious as I was too tired and struggling to keep a focus on homework and related tasks. Long story short told my parents I had been taking Adderall once and a while and we talked to the psychiatrist and he was very understanding and after trying to allow the SSRI to do its magic, he ultimately added an Adderall script to my regime.\\n\\nSo for some months I took the addy as needed and the anti-depressant as described (other than the days I forgot). So fast forward to summer and while I'm feeling marginally better, I was lead to believe the addy was doing most of the work. \\n\\nSo just last week I decided just to cold turkey the SSRI. Now, this was a slight test of seeing how I would react to abstaining from the meds (which is an awful idea). Strangely, I have noticed no real change whatsoever from when I was taking it to this past week of not taking it at all.\\n\\nI am somewhat familiar with the omens regarding stopping an anti-depressant cold turkey and the associated rebound depression and serotonin-related issues, however, I am unsure why I haven't experienced anything. The optimistic side of me wants to explain this as my body just being weird and being able to withstand this drug-related anomaly. The pessimistic side of me believes that it's related to escitalopram somewhat length half-life and that a nightmarish hell awaits me very soon.\\n\\nJust as a side note, at the same time as my depression diagnosis, I also got a blood test which delivered wonderful news that I had Lyme's Disease (which after much reading, I found exhibits many traits of depression and ADHD like disorders) and was promptly treated. Now I don't proclaim to be healed as I still exhibit a sense of lethargy, however, that might just be something I've become accustomed to and given getting out of my house, I am usually able to go out and be alive.\\n\\nObviously, not discussing this decision with my doctor is unnecessarily dangerous and naive, but I just don't enjoy taking the medication and this past week kind of supports my idea that I don't really need to take the medication if I am able to function fine without it.\\n\\nForgive me for this whole backstory of my last year, I just was unsure if some of this information might be useful in determining what's happening.\\n\\n**tl;dr**: got lethargic and lacked focus this last year, diagnosed with depression and Lyme's disease, been on escitalopram since spring and Adderall (whenever I choose to take it) since mid-Mayish.\\n\\nHave stopped taking escitalopram for about a week now and am not exhibiting any withdrawals or issues regarding the cold turkey. My question is: am I an anomaly or am I due for a bitter time in the near future? \\n\\nQUICK EDIT: just wanna say I tried looking up this lack of side effects from cold turkey, but all I can seem to find is the side-effects of not taking the medication, so if someone has some website or anecdotal experience they can refer me to, that would be much appreciated :)\", 'Random girl asked me awful question today.\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m not sure if this is the right place to post this or not, but I need to get this off my chest. \\n\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ve struggled with depression for about 3 years now and Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had my highs and my lows.

We generally chat online, although we've met up in real life a number of times, and talk on the phone sporadically.\\n\\nThey have an issue with trust. They believe no one cares about them and that every friend they have will eventually leave them. So fairly insecure. They are currently attending therapy (have for a number of months) to help them with their anxiety. They are meditating etc. \\n\\nAt a certain point I stepped up and decided, 'Okay, if they truly believe this about themselves, that people always leave them, I'm going to be the person who doesn't.' For the record, I know of a mutual friend who did push this person randomly out of their lifeâ\\x80\\x94so as far as I know, it's not a lie.\\n\\nAnyway, I stepped up because I thought this person was pretty special and intelligent. I loved that they were passionate and outspoken and unique. Over time, I developed some feelings for them too but more a great love as a friend than anything too romantic. \\n\\nAnyhow, we grew close. We shared many things, pretty much every day, although I believe she feared that she was abusing the friendship because I would try and reassure her a lot. She asked for my advice, and I gave it without thought. When she was upset, I tried my best to calm her down and express care. When she needed a boost, I gave it to her. She was worth my time. And she did the same for me. Because she was going through a hard time in general, I did all this because she was who she was.\\n\\nThen...we had a couple of fights. Nothing horrible, and we supposedly worked through our problems but...I've been having my own issues recently. After the last fight, where we talked everything out on the phone and she expressed the qualities she liked about me, as a friend, and how she was afraid that doing so in the past had pushed people away...well.\\n\\nNow, she's cold and distant. Not 100%, but there's something sincerely off, enough to notice. Phrasing that you wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t use with a friend, let alone an acquaintance. I have years and years of examples to the contrary and Iâ\\x80\\x99ve asked a therapist friend to have a look at the differences as well. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s definitely changed; it's definitely not just me.\\n\\nSupposedly, sheâ\\x80\\x99s looking after her mental health. I can see how having a person there to always reassure them may lead to this person not being as eager or able to rely on themselves, but we could have worked this out. I would have supported them through it. My support was enough up until three weeks ago when something quite major occurred and upset them. Now, I get â\\x80\\x98Well, I suppose thatâ\\x80\\x99s very kind of youâ\\x80\\x99 when I express concern for how she is and â\\x80\\x98How do I know that youâ\\x80\\x99re not rolling your eyes?â\\x80\\x99 when I express that I care and â\\x80\\x98What possible use could I be to youâ\\x80\\x99 when I tried to give her a little advice and express that she's important to me too. These are all usual parts of the conversation and nothing out of the ordinary from my side.\\n\\nHer manner and actions are a huge backflip, because less than a month ago she expressed how important and vital my friendship was to her because sheâ\\x80\\x94definitivelyâ\\x80\\x94knew I cared about her (and suspected others didnâ\\x80\\x99t). She also stated that she was going to be a better friend. Now I hear â\\x80\\x98I need balance in my lifeâ\\x80\\x99, as if it was a major issue to be close to someone. The two thingsâ\\x80\\x94better mental health/developing more of an ability to take care of oneself *and* having someone close to confide inâ\\x80\\x94are not mutually exclusive.\\n\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ve lost a decent amount of sleep over this because the support was reciprocal, so it feels like I've lost a large part of my support network. Iâ\\x80\\x99m looking for any opinions on what I should do here, because Iâ\\x80\\x99m hurting and itâ\\x80\\x99s already been a bad time (of which this person is aware). I've already asked them twice what's up and the question has been turned on me both times, as if I'm the one with the issue. \\n\\nI don't want to cut them off because they really do mean a hell of a lot to me, but is that all I can do here? I've tried to just back way off for the moment and see if they realise what they've done on their own.\\n\\nP.S. This is a six-year friendship.

He would tell everyone to go after me, in CoD, he would tell everyone to go to his lobby because he\\'s the \"leader\"\\n\\nbut the sole reason I\\'m making this post, was the fact that he did one of, if not, the RUDEST thing ever, here\\'s how it went\\n\\nit was my sister\\'s birthday, I was texting, and he said that he\\'s coming to the party, and I\\'m pretty happy, a smile stretches around my face, I say \"OK cool, :)\"\\n\\nan hour passes by, and he nonchalantly says, \"welp sorry I can\\'t come, oh well\" and I ask why?

She said this how her and her family always talked. I thought I known you for 7 years...never heard of this. Then she continued to talk and yup calling me a bitch. \\n\\nI continued telling her to stop at times. Other times I just tried to ignore. \\n\\nOne month ago she texted me that shes working with a nurse who is a woman who has a grill in her mouth.\\nAnd how cool she thought that was.

She said shes not about that girl power or that feminism crap! \\n\\nFYI...shes actually into feminism and don't know it. I would love to be a house wife,take my voting rights away and I love dresses. Shes willing to support a 3rd world man soon,talk about how if she gets a great degree she can support her man lol.\\n\\nI felt myself at the time great sadness here she was going off at me for not wanting to be called a bitch. She then says her family call each other bitches alllll the time. \\n\\nAfter she went off....she went back to talking about how she wants to go to school. I never felt so degraded and disrespected.  I decided this friendship ends. I'm very nice, and consider how others feel....she basically treated me like a door mat. \\nNext day I texted her I'm not a dog. Not into being called a bitch daily and I no longer can do this. After I texted that I blocked her number asap. \\n\\nIt's crazy about 3 or 4 months ago. She was mad that when she called a coworker a bitch instead of saying girl or other friendly terms...she caught that coworker talking about her warning others to stay clear of her because she will call you a bitch. She called me about it all mad. I told her I actually understand that girl....she completely ignored my remark.\\n\\nI plan on changing my number soon...maybe. \\n\\nBut I do feel better that I don't have to hear that hood talk anymore. \\n\\nI was her only friend.

I guess you could say he is the â\\x80\\x9cleaderâ\\x80\\x9d of our friend group. Because of this, no one does anything when he pulls a dick move. Everyone seems to worship him. He never thinks anything is his fault, even when he can do the most fucked up thing. He has no respect for anyone, heâ\\x80\\x99s extremely rude. I canâ\\x80\\x99t trust the guy cause heâ\\x80\\x99ll share your secrets to the whole group (including you) just to be funny. Heâ\\x80\\x99s a major hypocrite. He bullies my other friend. This guy has been pretty much my best friend for a very long time, and I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what to do. He says Iâ\\x80\\x99m his best friend, and it seems like that when itâ\\x80\\x99s only me with him, but when there are other people there, he just leaves me in the dust, even though he always complains about when his friends hang out with someone else (like I said heâ\\x80\\x99s a hypocrite).

What do you know? There I\\'d convieniantly a sub-reddit for this very issue I am having.\\n\\nFirst of all, I want to start off by saying, all of my friends are not terrible. The majority of them, yes.\\n\\nI feel like friends are supposed to add value and positive energy to your life and that is not happening in mine. \\n\\nIt has been becoming clear over the last few months and I think I need to figure out how to dump these friends that drain me. \\n\\nHere are some examples. I will use letters instead of their names.\\n\\nFriend A. \\nI have known A for about 10 years now. We worked together for many years. We partied together for many years. We have kept in contact for many years. I didn\\'t see A as much when I moved about a half hour away. Life happens. Things happen. People get busy and I totally understand that. I drive, she STILL doesn\\'t. We still remained friends though.  However..... I am the one who checks up on her and messages to simply see how things are or invite her somewhere. She gets a hold of me when she needs a ride or something. I can\\'t remember a time she has ever just called or texted to say hi and ask me how life is. I like A  because she is pretty easy to talk to. We have had a lot of good times and have made a ton of memories. One thing that I always tried to look past is her utter lack of manners. I don\\'t think in my ten years of knowing her I have ever heard her mutter a thank you. All of the things I have done for her, never once was there a thank you. I have given her tons and tons of rides and she has offered gas money and I never received a dime. I never expected a dime but if you are going to offer it at least honor your word. What really prompted this post was something that happened today. A is pregnant and she is due sometime in January. I hadn\\'t heard from any of our mutual friends about planning a shower so I messaged her best friend and asked If she had thought about doing so. Her best friend hadn\\'t even given it any thought. .... she said if I would like to take the reigns and plan it then she would help but had no interest in planning the party. I thought it was a little odd but I felt like A really should have a baby shower. I reached out to a few more people who I thought might have the same idea and they hadn\\'t thought to do it either. I\\'ll be honest, I am not a party planner. .. not even close. The thought of entertaining/interacting/etc with people makes me super anxious.... BUT all that aside... she is my friend and she deserves to be thrown a baby shower. I have been thinking about ideas over the past few weeks but haven\\'t put anything into motion yet. I get a message from her today over Facebook that says:\\n\\n\"So H informed me you guy were gonna plan a babyshower for me...well we was unaware so C and R are getting together to do one...so if you would like get in touch with one of them and details can be worked out....we just know we are having it October 14th\"\\n\\nI read it. My first initial reaction was annoyance. Since then it has progressed... I think I would have been less annoyed if there was a \"but thank you for thinking of me anyways\" or something along those lines. There is not one ounce of gratitude in this message. I\\'m kind of annoyed with myself for expecting there to be any at all. One would think I would have learned by now.\\n\\nSo, I guess the point of this rant is for me to figure out what I need to do about all of this. My gut is telling me it\\'s time to ditch the ungrateful, mannerless nonsense. The other part is sad to lose a \"friend\".\\n\\nAre my expectations too high? Is it wrong of me to expect my friends to have basic manners?

Please share your stories and give advice to those who post. \\n\\nSo hereâ\\x80\\x99s my story: \\n\\nSo my best friend of five years has had a boyfriend for over a year now. However, sheâ\\x80\\x99s recently been MIA. There has been times where I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t seen her for two weeks or maybe a month, but this time it was a lot more. Despite living a few minutes away from me, I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t seen her in 2 months!! Every time I asked her to hang out she would say that she was busy, but she wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t suggest meeting another time. We barely texted around this time either, I was the one that mostly initiated the conversations. Although she was busy, she was able to meet up with her boyfriend plenty of times who happens to live an hour away from her. She would always post photos of them together in social media and I would honestly feel upset. Eventually, I asked her to hang out again and she said that she had plans to go to the movies that night with someone else(not her bf), but that I could join. So we went to the movies and she dropped me off to my house right after the movie because she had to wake up early the next day. So we didnâ\\x80\\x99t really talk (since itâ\\x80\\x99s the movies) and I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t address how I felt about not seeing her since there was someone else there as well. Also, the only reason I saw her that one time is because I asked her to hang out. If I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t texted her, then she wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have invited me and I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have seen her. After that I didnâ\\x80\\x99t see her for a while either and I wanted to meet with her in person so that I could speak to her. A couple weeks later we finally saw each other. The first thing I told her was how I felt upset because I felt like she wasnâ\\x80\\x99t making much of an effort to even talk to me or see me. I told her that we should see each other more and she agreed. She then caught me off guard by stopping me and saying â\\x80\\x9cI know what youâ\\x80\\x99re going to say.â\\x80\\x9d She claims that she knew and that she had been feeling guilty for the past months. She then said that those months were kind of hectic because her bf was going through something. But thatâ\\x80\\x99s it... she didnâ\\x80\\x99t apologize and it just doesnâ\\x80\\x99t sit right with me. All she said was how she felt guilty and then mentioned something about her boyfriend to justify her behavior for the past months. We hung out for a couple of hours, however her bf kept calling her and sheâ\\x80\\x99d answer his calls during this time. Sheâ\\x80\\x99d recently gone on a short vacation and I didnâ\\x80\\x99t know when sheâ\\x80\\x99d returned to town until I saw a photo on Instagram of her and her boyfriend together. Iâ\\x80\\x99m honestly very mad and I feel as though I canâ\\x80\\x99t say anything because I had already mentioned it. What pisses me off more is when she had just gone on vacation for two days and posted a photo of her boyfriend on social media with the caption â\\x80\\x9cItâ\\x80\\x99s only been 2 days and I miss you sooo much!!â\\x80\\x9d Like are you seriously kidding me, you hadnâ\\x80\\x99t seen your friend in more than two months... Iâ\\x80\\x99m honestly so mad and I feel like I canâ\\x80\\x99t tell her without her getting mad. Sheâ\\x80\\x99ll probably get defensive since it involves her bf and since I mentioned it before. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s honestly the only best friend I have and I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what to do. I feel like Iâ\\x80\\x99m starting to resent them and I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to. Is there any advice that anyone can give me? ', \"Hearing my parents doing naughty things at night scars me.\\nHey guys, my name is Sally.\\n\\nI'm seventeen this year and it's 5am right now at where I live. I don't know how to phrase my words as my head is in a mess. \\n\\nTo provide some background story about myself, my family live in a compact flat and as a result, I sleep with my parents. In the bedroom, my parents sleep on the bed while I sleep on a mattress beside their bed. When I had nightmares when I was younger, I would squeeze in between them and only then, could I fall asleep. \\n\\nAs I got older, when I would replicate doing the same thing when I had nightmares, I would get scolded instead. That's how the bed was - just enough for 2 adults and 1 kid-sized human, I guess?\\n\\nSo I don't recall when - perhaps it was a year ago, when I heard the bed shaking continuously from my father's actions. He was also breathing heavily and there was this sticky sound too. Gross enough, I know. At that point of time, I was already mature enough to assume that he was masturbating. It was enough to scar me though, because it was just so strange to think of your dad fapping in the middle of the night, in the same room as his daughter. I pretended that I was asleep, but that was a really shitty experience tbvh. I tried to convince myself that he was doing something else, like rubbing his nose, and brushed it off. I just refused to accept that he might be doing something so dirty and it took me so many years of my life to actually realise it? What?!\\n\\nAlright so today, I found out that not only does my dad engage in that sort of behaviour, so does my mum. I'm shocked lol. I don't know how I should go about knowing this. I searched for some advice on Google too, and I now learnt that it's supposed to be 'normal'? Is it so common? I'm so shooked because I thought my family were a conservative bunch. I'm their youngest child, and I thought they would have stopped all perverted acts since I was born. \\n\\nSo how did I find out? I suddenly woke up to hear my dad shaking the entire bed again. This time, I was really unaware and asked my dad to shut up. Suddenly, my mum nagged at me slightly and I was so confused. My mum went to the washroom and started showering? Which was so odd and made no sense. And from the corner of my eye, I saw my dad wearing his underwear and pants! He slipped them on so easily I thought it might have been a daily practice for them. He zipped up his pants naturally and it came as an instant realisation to me that both of them were engaging in some indecent shit.\\n\\nWhat. The. Actual. Fuck. I slept in the same room with them for 17 years, and today I found out that both of them have been doing messed up shit and I was completely oblivious, up until today. It's so scarring, and I remember myself pretending I'm asleep. I knew before that my mum didn't wear a bra to sleep, but I really didn't know it might be more than just because it was more comfortable to sleep without one. Lmao.\\n\\nI'm really shocked at how they are doing things like this while I'm asleep. In the same room. And my dad makes such obvious sounds, I think it's sick. The thought of it disgusts me. I heard somewhere before that all men fap, regardless their age. Is it true? I'm starting to feel crept out, that men are so hormonal LOL. I suddenly feel so pure and this entire thought of my parents being naughty is scarring asf. Thoughts, anybody? \", 'Female reasoning\\nWhy does it seem most women try to justify or get approval of a friendship with a male by stating knowing then for a lengthy time. Do women truly feel that no platonic boundaries will be broken because theyâ\\x80\\x99ve â\\x80\\x9cknown each other for 15 years/since freshman yearâ\\x80\\x9d etc. \\nI donâ\\x80\\x99t believe it impossible for a platonic opposite sex friendship, but I do feel it is much harder for a male, for several reasons. Men typically seem to misinterpret a female being nice as expressing interest or flirting, that can easily plant the seed for a romantic attraction to develop. A mans â\\x80\\x9cnatural desiresâ\\x80\\x9d and wants, can easily blur the lines, and when in the right environment/setting they feel it is acceptable to attempt something etc etc. \\nI donâ\\x80\\x99t see how whatever length of time negates the possibility of anything happening. \\n\\nDo women honestly feel because of a long friendship ensures its innocence?

', 'Grandmother asks for loan to estranged father, then refuses to carry debt\\nI\\'m mostly estranged from my father who has narcissistic personality disorder, lives as a squatter in the forest, and works only part-time. Meanwhile, I work in Silicon Valley.\\n\\nHis sister made a huge effort to contact me, which I ignored for months understanding that she likely has a personality disorder as well. Eventually, I relented and agreed to meet my father for dinner over the holidays.\\n\\nIn February, I received a call from my paternal grandmother saying my dad needs a loan because he lost his temporary job (he has regular seasonal employment) and employment-insurance benefits have recently been changed where he lives. I called my dad and he asked for a loan of $5,000. I felt sorry for the guy, so I wired him the money. After further thought, I feel this is quite a bit more than he needs to be homeless for a few months and carry his credit card payments until getting new employment.\\n\\nMeanwhile, my grandmother has just sold her mobile home for $60,000 and left a voicemail to tell me of this and ask if I was willing to drive down and pickup some boxes. This isn\\'t realistic, if I did go there I would fly rather than drive for 8 hours.\\n\\nI called her back and asked if she would assume her son\\'s debt. This saves me the stress of servicing the loan and I have no interest in lending money whatsoever. Since she has cash from selling her house, she is easily able to do this now. Her son can pay her back.\\n\\nShe told me that the money from the house was needed for her retirement and that she\\'s \"on social security.\" I responded, \"I\\'m saving for retirement too.\" (I make the full $18,500 401(k) contribution each year to avoid ending up in the forest like my dad and this in addition to paying into social security which probably won\\'t even exist when I am 67) \"That\\'s no way to talk to your grandmother. I\\'m going to hang up if you...\" at which point I hung-up the phone.\\n\\nMy instinct her is to forget about getting the money back and just disconnect from all three: dad, grandmother, and the aunt (who I should have just ignored).\\n\\nAny thoughts?', 'I want to fix my best friend and I\\'s friendship, but I\\'m not sure if I should... any advice?\\nHi! I\\'ll try to make this as short as possible, but you can ask me for more details if you want to. My best friend (19/f) and I (19/f) met two years ago. We\\'re polar opposites, but we somehow became very close, and eventually started calling each other best friends (and other nicknames haha). It was awesome, and she\\'s the only person I feel that close with -- she\\'s like family (though I never told her that).\\n\\nBack in July though, I was feeling very drained. My best friend deals with severe depression and I was helping her a lot through it, willingly so. Honestly I felt fine for a year but I\\'ve been going through a huge identity crisis, trying to find myself and trying to know myself. I felt so confused and lost with myself -- I didn\\'t know what I wanted anymore. It was bad. It was very exhausting for me mentally but I thought the cause of how I felt was my best friend. You might ask why I thought that, well, whenever we\\'d hang out, I\\'d have to go out of my house. I\\'m an introvert, and I deal with a lot of anxiety, I always feel uncomfortable being outside. But considering I\\'d only go outside to hang out with my best friend, I thought *she* was the problem. I took me a while but I eventually decided, even though I didn\\'t really want to, to end the friendship. I thought this would make me feel better, like it was the key to my happiness or something.\\n\\nAfter I overcame the ugly crying phase that lasted for a week after I ended the friendship, I was feeling really good... for only a week. It was a sense of freedom like \"I don\\'t have to worry about anything anymore!!\". I started missing her real bad though. But I thought, hey, maybe I just miss the IDEA of her, and not really HER. So I waited to see if my feelings would change over time. \\n\\nBack in september, uni started. We shared the same classes. We saw each other again and I thought it was a good opportunity to talk to her again and explain some things out, and especially apologize to her (we had a bad argument when I told her I was ending the friendship), and she apologized too. She was really excited because some of her guy friends were with her at uni and she wanted me to hang out with them. I was still questioning a lot of things about myself at this point, and I was terribly anxious about starting uni, and also because I was scared her friends wouldn\\'t like me or think I\\'m too \"innocent\" or whatever. So I chickened out and decided to avoid her. Two days later, I dropped out of uni (not because of her), and didn\\'t say a word. I was feeling ashamed about dropping out and I had issues at home that made me feel really depressed, so I isolated myself BAD. I pushed all of my friends away, and eventually ended up alone, well, I still had some internet friends, but they didn\\'t last long because I ended up ignoring everyone\\'s messages. \\n\\nFast forward to now. I still miss my best friend terribly. Some days are worse than others. I thought I\\'d be over it by now but I always end up crying at night because I just want to talk to her and hang out like we used to. I tried to distract myself as much as I could, and I tried to make new friends, but every time, I ended up realizing that I was just trying to find someone to replace her, which obviously didn\\'t work out. I realized that I talk about her everyday still to my parents. My mom actually asked me how she was doing and I had to remind her that we\\'re no longer best friends. I still think very fondly of my best friend so when I talk about her, or think about her, it\\'s like nothing happened. I dream about her too sometimes.\\n\\nI want to contact her again. I want to explain to her everything I was feeling and tell her I want us to be friends again. But I\\'m scared. It looks like she\\'s completely moved on from me, and she has this new (guy) friend and they seem really close. It makes me sad because I feel like I\\'ve been replaced and I won\\'t be able to be her best friend again. I want to be here for her, laugh with her, cry with her, hang out with her, be by her side during the best and worst moments. I don\\'t want to be with anyone else. Just her. I can\\'t blame her for finding new friends and moving on, also her new friend seems like a really great guy, I actually think I\\'d get along with him. But I don\\'t know, it still makes me feel sad. It makes me feel like I shouldn\\'t contact her because she doesn\\'t need me in her life anymore and she forgot about me. I\\'m aware this is probably the case though.\\n\\nI\\'ve been thinking of making an audio where I just talk about what\\'s on my mind and talk about our friendship and send it to her. I\\'m so scared though. Is this a good idea or should I just drop it? It really makes me feel sad and I\\'m crying way too much over this -- I feel like, even if we can\\'t be friends again, I need some closure. I didn\\'t tell her everything when I ended the friendship, I only told her something like \"we don\\'t click anymore\", I\\'m not even sure because it was a lie. I didn\\'t want to hurt her feelings by saying her depression was hard for me to deal with because I also had my issues. I don\\'t know. Sorry I\\'m kind of a mess haha, I hope you can still understand what I\\'m saying.\\n\\nAlso -- if you think I should do the audio thing -- do you have any advice on what to say and what not to say? I\\'d really appreciate it.\\n\\n**TL;DR: I ended our friendship of two years because I was going through an identity crisis and she was dealing with severe depression and it made me feel terribly drained. I regret it though and I\\'ve been missing her so much but I don\\'t know how to contact her again as she\\'s got a new close friend and seems to have moved on. I\\'ve been thinking about making an audio for her where I talk about our friendship and what\\'s on my mind but I\\'m not sure if this is a good idea. Should I just drop it or still give it a shot? I deeply miss her and I can\\'t seem to get over her no matter how hard I try to. Also -- if you think I should do the audio thing -- do you have any advice on what to say and what not to say? I\\'d really appreciate it.**', \"My Father and Step-Mother sound like they will be getting a divorce.\\nI have three half siblings whom I'm relatively close to, two of them are teenagers and still under their parents' care. Anyways long story short it's my father's consumption of alcohol that's causing the damage. He does well for awhile then doesn't and it's been going on like this for years. Unfortunately my father and I aren't that close. It almost feels like we're walking acquaintances inside the same home when we have dinner together as a family. He seems distant to everyone in our family as well, it can be hard for him to open up. I think my father is really depressed, but he refuses to see a therapist or anything like that.  He may be going through some sort of (late) midlife crises right now. He still works his job and apparently brings home enough money to support his family. My step-mother took me aside and looked worried about her situation. She expressed that she may need to get legal help, and is concerned about protecting her children. At this point, I'm going to try and open up to my Dad and just point blank ask him what's going on with his life? He's about to lose his wife of 25+ years and hit a hard rock bottom. I hate to see him do this as he's been a pretty good Dad overall, and always provided for his family... at least keeping our heads above water financially. Any thoughts about how to approach alcohol use and possibly getting a stubborn old man to seek help? I know it's gotta be on his terms and everything, but I don't know what else to do. Thanks!\", 'A Long Story\\nSo hereâ\\x80\\x99s the situation I was and still sort of am in a group of four friends (friends for about 3 years). One of our four was a new girl who we added to the group about half of a year ago. But a few weeks ago three of us pranked the new girlâ\\x80\\x99s best friend, it did not go well and suddenly the NG stopped hanging out with our group (we hangout but mostly play games online).\\n\\nBut what I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t learn till the following week was that she wasnâ\\x80\\x99t hanging out with me and rest of the group was hanging out her behind my back. They lied about having things to do, or saying the were simply to busy to spend time together. When we did hangout the other two and I they both acted odd and withdrawn, I attempted to dig into why and even asked if it specifically related to NG but I got backlash for doing so so I let up. However later I learned about her not wanting/being to hangout with me was a â\\x80\\x9cinterventionâ\\x80\\x9d where the three of them sat me down and told me that NGâ\\x80\\x99s BF old her that She couldnâ\\x80\\x99t be friends with me anymore because her BF told her that it was all my fault and she had to choose between me and her BF in addition I learned that why my friends had been harsh and avoided me earlier in the week, they had lied to me about the whole situation. They knew about the ultimatum that NGâ\\x80\\x99s BF gave her the whole week and decided not to tell me till now, they claim it was to save my feelings but it didnâ\\x80\\x99t come off that way. The â\\x80\\x9cInterventionâ\\x80\\x9d ended with her leaving and me leaving as well.\\n\\nThe next couple of weeks are bad not only is our group divided, I am the odd man out they spend the bulk of their time with NG and ignore me for the most part. So I confront my two friends (one Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been friends with for five years and the other three), I tell them itâ\\x80\\x99s unfair that I am getting the short end of this situation when she made the decision to break up the group, I also tell them that the fact that they were willing to lie and go behind my back is wrong and that they justify it by claiming that NG is the victim because she lost a friend (so did I). They have apologized for the lying and going behind my back but I told them that I donâ\\x80\\x99t feel comfortable with them spending time with her and being friends with all the problems she caused me and their easy willingness to lie for her to me. They tell that they will always be friends with her and that I canâ\\x80\\x99t ask them to cut her off because it would divide the group, even though she already divided the group by pushing me out and they did nothing about it as a matter of fact the backed her up and supported her decision. So I told them that I have too walk away from the group then because I donâ\\x80\\x99t feel valued, respected, or able to trust them after what they have done.\\n\\nAm I in the wrong? What should I do should I walk away? I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to throw away my two closest friends but I feel like they donâ\\x80\\x99t even care about me anymore.\\n\\nI apologize for the long post.', \"Brother owes Mother money, lives with her and isn't paying rent. Advice please?\\nNot really sure which sub is the best place for this, so I've cross-posted in r/family, r/legaladviceuk and r/advice. Please let me know if any of them are inappropriate or if there are better subs for this. Thanks!\\n\\nThe back story to this is long and possibly convoluted, but the tl;dr is my brother has had financial troubles for many years. In 2012, after the death of our grandmother, our mother paid off a large sum of my brothers' debts. He then paid some of this back with his own inheritance from the same. As a result of various relationship and/or financial cock-ups he has then loaned various further sums from our mother but with almost no repayments. He then ends up in a position to either bail out back to our mothers or lose employment and go wherever it is you go when you have no home or job.\\n\\nTo be frank, we (myself, my partner and my mother) are at a loss as to what to do next. We think that perhaps we only have one realistic option (to kick my brother out and cut our losses) but this is something we would rather avoid. So we're asking Reddit for advice. So to  (try yet fail to) cut a long story short...\\n\\nMy brother moved back in with my mother in early December 2017 due to the breakup of a relationship. When he did so, he agreed (verbally) to both pay a very reasonable rate of rent and payments towards previous debts owed toward our mother (both monthly). He was given December as a 'payment holiday' of sorts. Two weeks later my brother took out a loan to replace his car as he needed transport to and from work. His previous vehicle was written off toward the end of his previous relationship and he did not replace it with the money gained from the resultant insurance claim. Due to poor credit history, our mother was guarantor for this loan.\\n\\nDue to concerns regarding my brothers previous unreliability with regards to money my mother decided to make a written and witnessed agreement with my brother regarding rent, the loan, and payment of previous debts. However, we are all collectively broke (not as broke as my brother) and so paid legal advice was out of the question. After some research I drafted a basic agreement, it was signed and witnessed by my mother, brother, partner and myself. In hindsight I should probably have used a solicitor for this but it is what it is. \\n\\nFast-forward to 05/02/2018 and no payments have been received for anything. My mother received both an email and text alert for late payment on the loan that she is guarantor of on 31/01/18 but no other correspondence. She has not contacted the loan company but has received no further correspondence so believes my brother has paid this instalment at least. My mother also received a phone call from the garage that my brother bought he new car from, for which he loaned the entirety of the cost as the majority of the loan my mother is guarantor. He still owes them money. \\n\\nIn short, besides kicking him out of my mothers house and saying goodbye to both my brothers previous debts (and therefore a large amount of my mothers money) and also resigning my mother to paying for the loan he took out in December, what can we do? Does the written agreement we made mean anything legally? What can I do to help my mother claim the money she lent previously? Or are these things lost causes? \\n\\nAny and all help is much appreciated. We just don't know what to do, but don't want to see my  brother completely on his arse (unless I've put him on it...).\\n\\n\\nTL;DR My brother owes my mother a significant amount of money, lives with her, she is guarantor for one of his loans, he has not paid his agreed rent etc. and we know he owes others money. What do we do now? Can kick him out, don't want to, seems likely may have to soon. Cannot live with or afford this.\\n\\nEdit: We are in the UK\", \"Advice to restore lost friendship?\\nMy cousin and I used to be best friends when we were little. We told each other everything and were inseparable. Then, a bunch of terrible stuff happened to her around middle school and in high school. She shut herself away. Even though we used to tell each other everything, she didn't talk to me as much after that. I love her, and I wanted her to know she could trust me, like she always could. But she didn't talk to me. Or anyone else. \\n\\nThen she moved a whole state away for a couple years. We drifted apart. Far apart. I used to consider her my very best friend, but at that point I didn't feel that way anymore. She now lives close to me again, and we have started hanging out again. I feel like we are starting to get our friendship back, but I still feel like there is something preventing us from getting back to how we used to be when we were little. She has depression and anxiety as a result of everything she has been through. I want her to know I am there for her and that she can trust me completely.\\n\\nI do know her well enough that I can tell when she is having a hard time with something, and today, I could tell she was struggling. I asked how she was doing, and she was upset because she and her boyfriend have been fighting a lot lately. I asked her more about it, but she didn't want to talk about it. That's completely fine; I understand. And I told her as much and also let her know I am always here for her if she needs anything.\\n\\nNow, I say all of that to ask this: how can I let her know that she can open up to me without sounding too pushy? I want to regain what we once had. How can I restore that closeness we used to have?\", 'What can I do so my friends donâ\\x80\\x99t constantly put me down.\\nSo lately Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been talking to more people and what not but I feel like I canâ\\x80\\x99t confide in anyone. So thereâ\\x80\\x99s that, on top of it, this past week someone Iâ\\x80\\x99d consider a close friend was having problems with this guy sheâ\\x80\\x99s kinda friends with and something happened and she blocked him and I pestered her about it because I wanted to see if I could help and she got mad at me and stormed off. Everyone else with us started ganging up on me saying stuff like â\\x80\\x9cThis is why nobody likes youâ\\x80\\x9d and then my other friend comes over and tells them to keep me in the room (Theater stuff). Now everyone seems fine with me but it really upset me and I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what I can do to change it. They said I ask the wrong questions and I feel like I just want to be included. Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry if this isnâ\\x80\\x99t the right subreddit or if Iâ\\x80\\x99m caught in the moment but Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had a day to think and it still is bugging me. ', \"Am I being a bad friend or is she?\\nHey, I'm kind of new to Reddit but I kinda need an opinion on a situation and I really hope the person I'm talking about never reads this. \\n\\nI have this close friend, (let's call her P) and lately, P and I have been having some problems. \\n\\nP is annoyed because she thinks I don't spend enough time with her. She's in one of my classes so I see her every other day for 2 hours but that isn't enough for her and she wants me dedicate my lunch time to her and spend more time texting her. She gets upset about this to the point where she sends me accusatory/passive aggressive texts during lunch about my location. Now keep in mind, I'm an honors student and I usually have club meetings or classwork to do during lunch periods and I barely see my other friends, who I'm much closer to and don't share many classes with, because of this.  \\nI'd be happy to spend time with her in a group of my friends (who she's also friends with) and spend time everyone but she gets mad or upset when I try to talk to my best friends.\\nAlso, I don't really like her personality sometimes. She's kind of vain and she flirts with my friends and she likes a lot of guys for simple reasons (i.e. this one guy who's really friendly waves at her every time he sees her in the halls and she had a crush on him for two months because of that even though he wasn't interested). And she always talks about herself and gets jealous of my friendship with the waving guy she liked, to the point where I've stopped talked to him so she doesn't tell me about her dreams in which I make out with the guy in front of her and make her really jealous. \\nHowever, she cut off most of her ties with her former friend group because they talked behind her back about how she only talks about herself and the current guy she has a crush on. \\nI understand her situation and that she feels like she's losing her only friend but I really don't like being controlled and walked on.\\nI also feel bad about her situation and I don't want her to cry, make me look like a bad person and talk behind my back to my friends/twist the situation (which she has done before) and my friends are either telling me to cut it off with her or that I'm overreacting and a bad friend so I'm posting on here for a second, unbiased opinion.

I made it a point to keep in touch with people especially during the holidays. Am tempted to zap this person and drop him but my wife says to let it slide. I would not say we are close but am perplexed at the rudeness of not even mustering a reply to a holiday greeting even if its fake. I've done nothing to this person except it came out during our last group get together that I went on to get a law degree at an elite school. I never even discuss careers or money at these things if that is the reason. Baffling. \", 'My sister wants to have an intervention with our parents about their marriage.\\nSo my sister and I are both adults. I\\'m 29 and she is 26. Neither of us live at home anymore. I have my ~~only~~ own little nuclear family now and she is renovating a house with her long time boyfriend. Since we have been adults we have noticed that our parents marriage isn\\'t exactly happy. Our parents are basically polar opposites. Dad is a really outgoing people person who likes to have lots of activities and friends. However, he is very very emotional and can blow up at the slightest hint of \"disrespect.\" If something is wrong it is never his fault, you know the type. Mom is quiet and reserved, not much on physical or verbal affection at all. Her only hobby/activity is through music ministry at our church. My dad joined the church when they got married, but he isn\\'t religious really and only comes on the holidays. Lately my sister has been really distressed by our parents relationship. She is very empathetic and it really upsets her when they fight. So much so, that she does not want to be around them anymore because of it. Today she told me that she thinks we should have some sort of intervention with them about their marriage. My sister and I have discussed before that they probably should really be divorced, but that it will never happen because our mom is Catholic. I think an \"intervention\" would just make it worse because I know my dad will see it as a personal attack. I\\'m of the \"it\\'s none of my business\" persuasion but I don\\'t want to miss out on family time with my parents and sister. We all get together every couple of weeks at my parents house for dinner and board games, which I love. I don\\'t want to lose that. Any thoughts? Is there anyway to approach our parents without making it worse?', \"How I'm coping with the end of a friendship...\\nI'm writing this partly because I find it therapeutic and partly because I'm hoping it'll help others.( I have self-proclaimed good coping skills.)\\n\\nSo, my XBFF didn't do anything [i]to[/i] me. There was no defining moment. I just decided that (as much as I love her) she doesn't compliment my life anymore.\\n\\nShe's having a few relationship issues. As a married woman, I empathize with her. However, over the last 6 months she's started to get a little... Crazy. \\n\\nI'm a very blunt and controversial person. Always have been, always will be. I keep an IG account full of controversial and offensive memes. Some people like it, some people don't. Anyway, I've been going through a rough time myself so I cope by posting passive-aggressive memes. Every single thing I post she takes personally. It got to the point in which everything I said or did (online or in the real world) she somehow thought was about her. It wasn't. It got to the point in which I was afraid to speak because I was afraid she'd take something the wrong way.\\n\\nAnyway, she went an entire week without speaking to me even though I sent her multiple texts. Maybe this was the moment, but I decided that I will not tolerate that type of power struggle. We're adults - you don't get to ignore someone because you don't like what they're saying and that's always been an issue with her: if she doesn't like what you have to say she comes up with delusional explanations as to why. Basically, she can never be wrong and if you think one negative thing about something related to her, she'll freak out, accuse you of being jealous even though she's the one not actually happy. The negativity is starting with her.\\n\\nFor example, we tried to book a trip together. We've been trying for years and they never happen. Finally, I just told her that I'm no longer interested in planning trips with her because she's not willing to accommodate my demanding work schedule. Now, she's the first to admit her job is shit and it's been a huge source of insecurity for her, but when I tell her that my job doesn't allow me to book off as easily as hers (she works cash and doesn't really have a true job) she'll freak out and accuse me of putting her down. No. I'm stating the facts: You can book off your job easily. I can't. That's not me putting down your job. That's me telling you why I can't tell my boss on Friday I'm leaving for two weeks the following Monday.\\n\\n(This is just one example, but they all pretty much follow the same context: Something TRUE she doesn't like about herself is brought to attention and she accuses you of being a bad friend.)\\n\\nAfter a week of being MIA she decides to text me. No. It doesn't work like that. I'm not interested in what she has to say. So, I tell her to get over herself, not everything in the world revolves around her, etc. Of course, she thinks she's completely innocent and that all she was trying to do was explain HER feelings and I tell her I'm not interested. Again, it's not always about her. She did not once seek clarification about ANYTHING I said. She jumped to random conclusions and just assumed I sit here and think about her. In the end, that's what frustrates me. I just can't be friends with someone who thinks everything is about her.\\n\\nIn sum, I just decided to protect myself. \", 'Should I meet estranged grandfather?\\nI\\'ve never met my  grandfather due to him and my grandmother being divorced, and my mother being the \"least favorite\" wants nothing to do with him.

Isnâ\\x80\\x99t that too harsh?.\\n\\nLater I approached to her to ask what was it that she gave mine a low grade.\\nThen, she rants out all the things Iâ\\x80\\x99ve done wrong, but she spoke so fast that I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t quite catch all of them.\\nAnd I became a bit angry at her attitude because\\n1. She spoke so fast (so I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t quite catch 30% of her points) which is likely to be intentional so Iâ\\x80\\x99m startled before I can argue back.\\n2.

Who are you kidding?â\\x80\\x99\\n\\nNow I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t really complain if she actually gave me valid constructive criticism,\\nbut she spoke so fast (likely to be intentionally) and most of her points came from simply her not reading carefully enough..\\n\\nBTW, she actually achieves better grades than I do and is clearly smarter than I am. Not trying to be boastful, but in this Literature class, I really think itâ\\x80\\x99s safe to say that I get better grades than her most of the times. And, sheâ\\x80\\x99s not a teacher. What the hell does she know better than the teacher to say things like that, especially when she gets lower grades than I do most of the time???\\n\\nBesides, she really always says rude things in front of someoneâ\\x80\\x99s faces (and many many times in front of my face).. and sheâ\\x80\\x99s sometimes in her own world and can get really arrogant and cynical.\\n\\nI guess Iâ\\x80\\x99m done with her right?

We're pretty close, not absolute besties, but at the level where we can share memes with each other at 3am and not think it weird. But this year she's the only one of my friends from last year that has the same lunch as me, so I sit with her everyday. The problem is her bestest friend in the whole world also has the same lunch, so I'm always the awkward third wheel. I always try to help her when she needs it because a, she's my friend, and b, she doesn't have an easy home life. She never has enough to eat at lunch so I always bring something extra, and she also always needs rides everywhere. She says it's because her guardian is at work, or is visiting other family, is babysitting, but I think her family just doesn't want to give her rides places. I don't mind most of the time, but it's gotten to the point where she almost assumes we'll give her a ride when she needs it, and we can't always do that. She also stopped coming to lunch last week to go practice in the orchestra room, and I never even see her until orchestra class. I know something's not right, but every attempt to figure it out has gone unrewarded. I've made new friends this year through cross country and orchestra, and they have the same lunch I do. I went and sat with them one day, but my other friend looked almost mad when I told her I was sitting with them just for that day. It's okay for you to ignore me most of lunch and then not even show up and not answering me when I ask where you've been, but I can't make new friends and sit with them every now and then? I'm just not sure where to go from here, because I don't want to stop being friends, I really don't, but I just feel like my new friends can be better friends, and friends I can relate to better.

Before dropping her baby off, I always vacuumed because she spent all of her time on the floor. Nothing dangerous in her reach (obviously, I Baby proofed for my kids). She was rolling around and got over by my shoe rack and found something I didnâ\\x80\\x99t see and, like babies do, she stuck it in her mouth. I went over to her and did a finger sweep to remove it but I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t get it and it made her gag; not choke, gag. So I angled her down, patted her back and it fell out. She smiled at me when I turned her right side up, obviously unfazed by what just happened. I stayed calm, and did what needed to be done, no harm. Told mom about it and she seemed unfazed as well and stayed and chatted and left shortly after. Thought everything was fine until just a few nights ago. She sends me a text; thatâ\\x80\\x99s right, a text, and basically tells me that I can no longer be trusted to watch her kids and that the state of my house shouldâ\\x80\\x99ve been a red flag. (My house is lived in, not a pig sty). She said I dropped the ball and let her kid stick something in her mouth and she couldâ\\x80\\x99ve choked. Also, I was so nonchalant about telling her about it and that means I was lazy and didnâ\\x80\\x99t see it as a big deal. News flash- it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t a big deal, nothing happened.  She said she wants me to apologize for putting her daughters safety at risk and that basically this friendship is over. Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry but if itâ\\x80\\x99s safe enough for my twins itâ\\x80\\x99s safe enough for her daughter. She found something that I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t see from my view point and stuck it in her mouth. I stayed calm, responded and everything was fine. Should I apologize? Did I do something wrong? She is refusing to talk to me face to face. I donâ\\x80\\x99t feel like I should apologize for something every baby does. I just canâ\\x80\\x99t believe she held onto this for so long. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve even hung out since then and she never said anything. Just some advice please. ', 'Roomie read a text I sent about her on another friends phone\\nSo I\\'m gonna delete this right after but I kinda fucked up bad... I\\'m a 24 yo female btw living in an apartment w 4 other ppl. Ok so I came home from a stressful night and one of my roommates was drunk af, I left to go see a friend for a bit and when I returned there was a pot of mac and cheese sitting on the stove with the burner on high and no one was around... turns out drunk roomie started cooking then abandoned it there. What annoyed me more was that it was my mac and cheese she cooked and burnt. I understand we get drunk and we take our roomies food... it happens ok, I\\'ve done it (rarely) but yeah it happens. I was mainly annoyed that the stove was on high and left unattended while she went out partying! If I wouldn\\'t have come home it could have started a fire. SO me being the idiot I am, I sent a text to our other roomie just explaining that I was a bit annoyed that our other roomie left the stove on and was also using my food wo asking. It wasn\\'t shit talking in my opinion, as the text legit said.. \"I just came home and _____ left the stove on and burnt food and left it there and it was also my food so I\\'m a bit annoyed\" Me and said roomie had been talking earlier about how we were a bit annoyed she came home so drunk and loud. I legit just said I was a bit annoyed bc she left the stove on and used my food. But I wasn\\'t like incredibly mad I was just venting bc I know I\\'d get over it in an hour and just tell her tomorrow not to leave food unattended or ask if she\\'d like to take some of my food.... SO here\\'s where im dumb.... my other roomie left her phone in the kitchen and the message must have popped up or the other girl was snooping through her phone and saw it.... she then proceeded to text me bitching me out and sending awful passive aggressive texts. I remained calm and mature and just explained that yes I was a bit annoyed, but I didn\\'t send the text to be malicious or shit talk, and that I wasn\\'t mad at her. She turned it all around on me and now I\\'m left feeling like the mean person. The only person I normally vent to about friends is my sister and no one else.. I don\\'t like \"shit talking\" but everyone gets annoyed and needs to vent from time to time. It\\'s healthy to get it off your chest and I didn\\'t mean for her to see it... also it wasn\\'t a mean text or anything....and also she was the one to disrespect me so I feel I had a right to be annoyed, though I shouldn\\'t have sent that text but it could be a lot worse ... WHAT DO I DO NOW. She\\'s so mad and ignoring me. Ugh. ', 'My mom showed heavy favoritism to sister, and i deeply resent both of them.\\nSo, i\\'m 20. Iâ\\x80\\x99m a pretty happy, go lucky person, but whenever i think back to my childhood i instantly get depressed and cannot function. This has been haunting me for years, and i\\'d love to get it out in the open. But, i would like it if someone could read this and tell me, if i have legit reason to be upset about this, or if i\\'m overreacting?\\n\\n\\nSo, in my first 6 years, i was a normal, happy kid. I had a warm, happy family. My parents were just normal, i was a little spoiled, but when your the first born, that\\'s kind of a given, right?\\n\\n\\nBut that all changed when i was 5, my mom announced she was pregnant. with another baby. At first, i was happy, i knew what was happening, since i saw it on tv before. Mom still had time for me, of course that all changed when i was 6. I was in 1st grade when she was born. Until she was born, my parents spent literally all their time with me.\\n\\n\\nHere is when the bs started. .\\n\\n\\nSo, to start was her actual birth itself. It was a saturday, mom went into labor. I was in my bedroom, playing a video game. Then, during the middle of my game, i heard tires squealing, i looked out my window and saw the family car speeding off. They forgot me, i at first thought they were rushing to the corner store, since mom had some bizarre cravings, mostly for their pizza. But hours went by, i started to worry, and after almost 6 HOURS, someone came to the house to get me (my grandmother). I was kind of peeved, but my dad promised to get me ice cream, so all was settled.\\n\\n\\nSo, next was the sleeping arrangement. Every night, i slept right between my parents. I never slept alone, they tried to ween me, but i wasn\\'t particularly fond of my bed. I liked sleeping with them, because it was warm, and i\\'ve always had this \"thing\", where i have to run my fingers through someone\\'s hair before sleeping, i kind of grew out of it, forcefully.\\n\\n\\nHow? Well, i never got to share a bed with mom again, me and my dad were regulated to the guest room. Mostly because i didn\\'t sleep alone (i never started until i was about 12). Every night after that, my mom took my sister into my spot, she said she\\'d come get me to come in her bed after my sister fell asleep, but guess what? She never did. Not once did i sleep with mom ever again.\\n\\n\\nWe later moved in with my grandma, who only had 2 rooms. I slept with mom and sis every night, and she always pryed and forced herself between me and mom.\\n\\n\\nCome to think of it, mom never really had time for me any more, i had to start taking the bus to school. since she had no babysitter, plus dad worked.\\n\\n\\nI kind of always prefered mom, to my dad. She was a lot more fun, and creative. She made me a marble box out of popsicle sticks once. But, she kind of pawned me off on my dad after the devil child was born.\\n\\n\\nSadly, when i was 7, my parents divorced and me, my sister, and my mom lived with my grandma.\\n\\n\\nNow, when i was 9, i had gotten involved in 4-h. I had a talent for writing and giving speeches. So, it was a big deal for me. I was the best in my class, and even made it to county competition. One of only 5 kids in my school. It was my proudest moment, since i always sucked at sports.\\n\\n\\nSo, we got to the place, there were 50 people listening to me give my speech, i had my little suit, and was very proud of myself. I practiced hours a day, i wanted to go to state as well. And as soon as i get to the podium, guess who starts crying. Loud enough that everyone can hear it. My sister. So, mom had to take her out. She never saw my speech. I gave it, but i just couldn\\'t do it right, i was on the verge of crying myself from what happened. I was too upset that she was missing it, i got a \"Participant\" ribbon, my big moment was ruined. I was gonna do it again next year, but when i wrote my speech, i had no enthusiasm for the project, and it lacked the \"zing\" the previous one had, so i didn\\'t advance very far. I honestly didn\\'t care anymore, mom asked about it, I told her my sister would probably ruin it.\\n\\n\\nShe started growing up, and became an even more entitled little tyrant. Here we start on her as a tween. She just got so much worse.\\n\\n\\nFirst of all, mom really only paid attention to her. She never came in my room to come visit, at all. That\\'s a general example, here is a more specific list.\\n\\n\\nFirst of all, there was one time that my pants had a hole, the pocket ripped and my wallet fell out, and I never noticed until the next day. She found it, and instead of returning it, she took $100 out of it, then returned it the next day. Worst of all, she told mom to promise not to tell me that she took it, she bought a cell phone with it. I didn\\'t even find out until almost 10 years later.\\n\\n\\nAnytime I would try to spend time with mom, she\\'d always come in. I never got alone time with my mom, without her rearing her head. That was if I even got to spend time with her at all. She\\'d promise to spend time with me, but Iâ\\x80\\x99d either wait forever, and Iâ\\x80\\x99d be too tired to do anything. Or, she\\'d never show up at all.\\n\\n\\nOne time, it was about 8, I asked if she wanted to play Tetris. She said she\\'d love to, in a few minutes. So, I loaded up Tetris, paused it and waited. Keep in mind, I couldn\\'t really do anything else. It was nearly 2 and a half hours. She never showed, so I went to bed, I could hardly hold my eyes open. She finally did show, she got mad and said \"I thought you wanted to play?\" But, I told her \"I couldn\\'t wait forever.\"\\n\\n\\nHer excuse was that she had to wait for my sister to go to bed, because Iâ\\x80\\x99d get mad if she came to play too. Instead of saying \"No, I want some quality time with my son\", she just waited till absurd hours of the night, knowing Iâ\\x80\\x99d be too tired to play.\\n\\n\\nThat was how it was any time I wanted to play with mom.\\n\\n\\nMinor story, I got a bop it toy for Christmas. She asked to borrow it and take it to school, she had to write her name on it so if it got lost, the school would know who it belonged too. She never gave it back, and about 2 weeks, her and mom were playing with it, I asked if I could have it back, and she said it was hers. I never saw it again.\\n\\n\\nOne time, she broke my tv. She got the day off from school, faking being sick (Iâ\\x80\\x99ll get to that in a moment). While at school, she lounged around my room all day, and somehow broke my tv. I have no clue how, but it\\'s just when I got home it was broken. She never got yelled at or punished whatsoever.\\n\\n\\nThe time I got the flu. All night I had been chilled, shivering, and sick. I felt awful, I told my grandma, and she let me take the day off and would take to the doctor\\'s office that day.\\n\\n\\nThat morning, I got yelled at, accused for playing hooky. I got took to the doctor, and guess what? I was diagnosed with the flu. Mom changed her tone, and acted nice and as if she was worried the whole time. I got guilted for needing to miss a week. Then the next day, guess who got the flu? My sister.\\n\\n\\nSo, she got tested. Guess what, no flu. She acted sick all morning, but as soon as mom told her she could miss school, 2 hours later, she was riding her bike and doing cart wheels in the yard. No yelling, no punishment\\n\\n\\nOne time she threw my 80\\'s, rare wrestling figures into a muddy ditch, ruining the paint job. Nothing.\\n\\n\\nThere was one birthday, she got $100, my birthday came, only 75.\\n\\n\\nYou know, around this time I started to watch lots of anime. I pretended I was in their worlds, it always brought me happiness. I tried to get my mom interested, but she never did. Then, one weekend, I asked her to play Mario with me, like the good old days. But, my sister showed up, with a Dragon Ball Z DVD, battle of gods movie. She asked if I wanted to watch it, I said no because Iâ\\x80\\x99ve seen that movie 10 times already. Mom got mad at me, and watched it with her. For 5 years Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been begging her to watch it with me, but she never could. I sat and watched it with them, because she said if I did, she\\'d play with me. She sat through the whole movie with her. So, after waiting over an hour for her to play with me. She finally showed, played one level, and went to bed because she was too tired. We\\'d play in the morning she said, that morning never came.\\n\\n\\nThen, my graduation. Around this time, she moved in with our dad. They all came to my graduation, but she mostly talked to her the whole time, begging her to come visit.\\n\\n\\nAlso, funnily enough, I never got told congratulations or anything for graduation. She never posted how proud she was of me on Facebook, or anything. But, that same year, my sister made the honor roll. I never heard the end of it.\\n\\n\\nSo, recently, last year I got an injury. and that brought on a whole slew of crap.\\n\\n\\nMost of these involve me wanting privacy for my problems and her showing up when not wanted.\\n\\n\\nFirst, was physical therapy. She just had to come, without even asking me, mom said yes. I told her no, I didn\\'t want her to go. We had a huge fight, and we didn\\'t go.\\n\\n\\nThen, was a checkup. I didn\\'t want her to come, but she did anyway. There was no reason for her to go, they just sat in the lobby. This was a very personal thing, and I wanted as few people there as possible.\\n\\n\\nI remember mom wheeled me in, (I was in a wheelchair), and sis said she\\'d wait in our car. Nope, guess who walked in. Mom largely ignored me at my own appointment. Therapy and Doctor\\'s appointments were the only time we really got together.\\n\\n\\nThen, another time I asked her to play a game with me. She actually did, then in 5 minutes, guess who called out. My sister, mom just disappeared, and never came back, so I just turned it off.\\n\\n\\nAnd finally, the most recent example. I actually planned on moving out. I needed a 10-dollar box. I begged and asked for weeks, and it took seemingly forever to buy me that box, but my sister asked for a 300-dollar dress, and she got it bought for her in less than a day.\\n\\n', '[Serious]I broke a close friends heart and now i don\\'t know what to do?\\n[Serious] So i\\'ve been friends with this girl for around 4 years and we got really close for the past 1 year. I started having problems with other friends family and uni like 3 months ago. Basically a depressive state. And i started to treat this friend badly during these months. Sometime i would realize it and go \"sorry i\\'ve been treating you bad for the last couple of days because of etc etc\" And she always went it\\'s okay i can understand you. For the last 2 weeks i realized that she started ignoring my texts and stuff. I waited 5 days for a reply to a single text. At the end i got mad and texted her again saying \"I don\\'t know what to think of you anymore\" Then she replied to that with a long text blaming me for stuff and how i\\'ve changed, how we didn\\'t get to know each other properly etc. and a few other stuff that she got completely wrong idea of. I replied with a long message explaining everything to her but she didn\\'t reply to it. We haven\\'t talked for a week. Today i wrote a handwritten letter to her and im planning to send it to her tomorrow. It\\'s a 3 page long letter explaining how sorry i am, how i ruined stuff and telling how much i love her and how much i want her to forgive me. ( i know it sounds bad in sentence but it\\'s actually a very touching letter ) Do you think i should send it? I\\'m actually afraid that she might not open the letter at all when she sees that it\\'s from me. I really want her back and regret everything i did.', 'Having troubles reconnecting with an old friend.\\nAloha Reddit. So I\\'m a guy and I\\'m trying to reconnect with an old female friend of mine. Long story short, she stopped talking to me and then I stopped talking to her but she thought I was the one who stopped talking to her and so we ignored eachother for three years even though we go to the same school. Recently, I texted her saying that I apologize. She said that she\\'d give me a second chance, so I start texting her questions to get to know her again, but she takes hours to answer and when she does answer, all she says is \"Yes/no, you?\" When I ask her a question and \"Haha ok\" when I answer my own question. She even leaves me on read sometimes. Should I stop texting her? I really don\\'t understand why she decided to give me a second chance if she won\\'t even try to support the conversation. Just saying \"Sorry, I don\\'t wanna talk to you anymore\" would\\'ve been a lot less painful.', '21/F/US Looking for a long term friend\\nHello! My name is Mousey and I live in Georgia. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been very busy with school, work, and starting my own business. Iâ\\x80\\x99m looking for people I can have serious connections with.

So, time zones donâ\\x80\\x99t really bother me.\\n\\nI have an open mind, and I love sharing thoughts and ideas with people.

I have a brother, 29, turning 30 this year, who lives with my parents. My parents sold their house and have not yet decided where to live. They are 65 and 70 and are retired. We own a small apartment building and live in it and rent the units. My parents will have some cash and also have monthly income, but my brother appears to be very depressed, may also have some untreated medical issues, and is a sober alcoholic who may be abusing prescription drugs (not pain pills, but Xanax &amp; Ativan? Not sure). He seems to sleep all day and rarely goes to his job, which is doing over other people\\'s houses as a contractor. He owns his own truck and tools. My parents are worried they\\'ll \"lose\" him when they move if he doesn\\'t move with them, but nobody knows what to do or what his real problem(s) are.\\n\\nIs it a stupid idea for us to just have everyone live in our building and subsidize my brother\\'s \"rent\" by having him pay some nominal amount subject to regular psychiatry and/or other requirements? Has anyone done this? Is there another sub that is better for these types of questions? I don\\'t know if anyone knows what to do anymore. My mom enables him but is finally making an appointment for him to see an internist, though he is very manipulative and secretive so I don\\'t know what to do or if anything else can be done and I am somewhat concerned he will manipulate the internist--he\\'s very deceptive.

There's no set schedule, except for one family dinner and one family breakfast.  Everyone is in different life stages, so it was best to let everyone venture off on their own.  I figured we'd coordinate events and rides with folks once we got there but nothing set in stone. \\n\\nMy cousin lives there, about 25 minutes from where we are staying and I haven't seen her in years since she moved due to bad timing and life events. We were going to go meet her for dinner one evening (probably about an hour or so) during the trip. \\n\\nIs this rude?  I mentioned it to my MIL and she didn't look happy and I felt like she was biting her tongue. \\n\\nMy MIL and FIL are paying for the whole trip, but they wouldn't be paying for this dinner. \", \"My dad's mad after game night.\\nMy family and I were playing board games two nights ago. We finished the first one which went well, it was fun. We switched to the second game that 4/6 of us had played before. After my brother finished explaining the rules my dad (who has played before) asked a  really stupid question, so we thought he was joking. He then got really mad while we were answering his question, got up, and said he's not playing anymore. The next day we didn't say anything to each other. Today, we still haven't said anything to each other and he's clearly mad. \\n\\nShould i say something to him or let it pass?\", 'Living At Home With Untrustworthy Family Member\\nThis post may be a bit long, but I really need advice , outside of the obvious \"just move out\" , which I will be doing soon, but I need advice for until I do.\\n\\nSo I live at home with an untrustworthy uncle who has shown me that I can\\'t trust him. He talks about people behind their back, personally talks down to me, purposely does things to hold me back (such as will place a setback in my way knowing it will affect my moving out --- he asks me to drive someone somewhere using my car during the time I have to be at work, ect.) .\\n\\nAnyway,  my uncle wants me to contribute to the household by paying $50.00 towards the electric bill. So I go, \"Ok, no problem.\"\\n\\nThat is a big problem because I was initially thinking I could go to a bill payment center and just directly pay it there as my debit card company (AMEX, Visa, ect) isn\\'t accepted by the electric company. I called the electric company and was told if I go to a billpayment center that I need the bill or at least the account number. I have neither and am unable to access either because my uncle takes the bill . I have asked to see it, both asking my aunt and uncle. \\nMy aunt says \"I am trying to complicate things,\" and informed me that my uncle pays everything via his bank account,which really means to \"contribute\", I am really having to pay my uncle $50 after he pays the whole bill from his bank account. \\n\\nI don\\'t want to do that because I am looking at having to give him that $50 , which is really going in his pocket, versus to the electric company, as a waste of money. I want to be sure my money is going where it is supposed to go (to the electric bill, and not in my uncle\\'s pockets).  When my sister lived here, they let her have access to the bills and pay them or parts of them how she wanted.  We are two years apart, her being 28, and me being 26.  My uncle wastes a lot of money on hookah, and products on Amazon. He believes that my grandmother\\'s house is his house (which is not true at all.) \\n\\nThey, being my uncle and aunt are not allowing me to do things the way I want. I want to ensure that my money is going directly to the electric company in particularly because when I have contributed to the household as they (my aunt and uncle) have asked, I have watched my money be used in an unscrupulous manner and have had to deal with them (my aunt and uncle) basically monopolizing my time, so I can never progress with what I need to do in life, such as move out. My aunt tried to ask me how much money I bring in a month, and I refused to tell her. In my family, my family feels like if you are not forthcoming with information then something shady or bad has to be going on. In my case, that is not true. I am a young woman wanting to better herself and continue pursuing her passions (ones that actually will provide for myself and my OWN family --- children, ect if I have any) and leave a legacy behind when my time comes.  I am thinking not of just today, but later on down the line. \\n\\nMy uncle is very immature. While his mother (my grandmother) was in the hospital due to a heart attack and stroke, he brought a random woman over and had sex with her in his mother\\'s bed, and the girl was very loud and disrespectful considering that I am right down the hall. (Keep in mind, he has his own room on the third floor of the house where no one would be able to hear or see anything he is doing). He also has a superiority complex. \\n\\nMy grandmother is still sick, and is supposedly coming home soon. I am trying to save so I can move, and have been the one helping my grandmother while she is sick. I am aware that I am dealing with a toxic family member (well, family members.) \\n\\nMy uncle will downtalk me, calling me a bum, saying I don\\'t have certain things, because he doesn\\'t see where any of my money is at or goes (He isn\\'t supposed to, I am a grown adult) , but at the same time, putting every road block in my way to keep me in a position where I can\\'t get on better footing. I honestly feel my family just wants someone that they can talk about and put down. I have told my family that I don\\'t have access to cash, so I can continue to save and move. I did say I can contribute in other ways. I have been the pariah of my family due to what a lot of people have said about me, lies and things that are untrue. I have family members that just want me to fail. I know that for sure.\\n\\n I have thought about waiting for next month\\'s bill to come, and taking the account number off of it to directly pay my portion of the electric bill. \\n\\nTo anyone who feels I may be being selfish, complaining , or lazy,  I am none of those things. I am currently working and saving money to move to another state. I was taught at an early age to trust my gut, and everything is all messed up right now. I have watched my family and am aware of how they operate. I don\\'t want to be around people I can\\'t trust. Family will betray you faster than your enemies. \\n\\nI am asking regarding this situation, what should I do and what advice do you suggest for dealing with toxic family members who make fun of your dreams and put obstacles in your way to hold you back from succeeding ? Also getting the account number off of the bill after the bill comes --- how good of an idea is that?', 'A friend cut me off\\nSo recently a friend of mine cut me off and Iâ\\x80\\x99m not really sure why. I guess to understand my concern it would be best to get the whole story. \\nI had first met her earlier this school year. Our desks were right next to each other in math class. Back then, she was very talkative, sociable, optimistic, and energetic around me. Iâ\\x80\\x99m not always the most talkative type but that didnâ\\x80\\x99t seem to bother her at all. She always shouted for my attention to say hi to me when passed each other in the halls. She asked for my number, introduced me to a few of her friends, and even invited me over to her house for lunch during one of our off periods. We texted a couple times though I will admit each time I kept feeling like I was annoying her. \\nEventually, she had invited me to come with her boyfriend and group of friends to hang out at the mall over Christmas vacation. I was so excited. However, when the day finally came, I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t help but feel like a third wheel. She was much more focused on her boyfriend than she was on anyone else and the only time she noticed me was when I had wandered off without telling any of them. That wasnâ\\x80\\x99t cool of me, I admit, but I just didnâ\\x80\\x99t feel needed or even wanted there at times. Later that night though, I texted her and apologized for not being that social but she it was all fine. \\nBut I still couldnâ\\x80\\x99t shake the feeling that she was upset with me. When we came back from vacation, my suspicions grew. She was a lot more quiet and distant from me and was usually on her phone with her headphones in whenever I was around. It was around this time that I started to become a lot more needy. She still responded to my texts and told me that the reason she was so quiet was because she had a headache. But I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t help but notice that she was still pretty social around her other friends. At one point when we were walking in the halls, she had her headphones in and didnâ\\x80\\x99t say a word to me but the minute she saw one of her other friends, she took her headphones out and screamed for his attention. All while I was standing right next to her. \\nIt was a week before winter vacation when we got into an argument. You see, she was aware of my depression and offered her assistance in helping me deal with it. However, in our argument, she expressed her displeasure with how she felt she was putting in all the effort into dealing with my problems. I tried apologizing to her, probably getting a bit too dramatic about it, but she just expressed her annoyance at how I constantly needed her assurance and that if I donâ\\x80\\x99t try to change myself, she wonâ\\x80\\x99t be my friend anymore. Eventually, I apologized for my part in the argument and how I didnâ\\x80\\x99t make her help feel appreciated, but I also explained to her that I was doing something about my depression. I see a psychiatrist and take antidepressants every night. Still, she insisted that I needed to change. But by this point, whenever I spoke to her in person, she always seemed disinterested and kind of annoyed. When I asked her if she had a problem with me, she would always say that she was either busy or wasnâ\\x80\\x99t in the mood for it. Eventually, she responded that she needed space for the whole vacation, so I didnâ\\x80\\x99t text her at all. But when the vacation was over, I tried to text if everything was fine now only to discover that she had blocked my number. Now, she doesnâ\\x80\\x99t even acknowledge my presence anymore and almost seems to actively avoid me. \\nI apologize if this is really long. I just wanted to be as detailed as possible. At this point, I just feel at a loss and confused about what happened. Iâ\\x80\\x99m not sure if I did something wrong or if she was ever my friend at all. I mean, our friendship felt genuine those first months before Christmas. But now I just donâ\\x80\\x99t know what to think or do.\\n', \"my cousin\\nLong story short, I have an 8 year old cousin and I don't like him. I'm 19 going on 20 by the way. My mom babysat him when he was a newborn till when he was about 2. I always felt kind of jealous because my mom completely forgot about my dad and I when she babysat him but I always kind of understood that she wasn't doing it intentionally because kids are so high maintenance at that age. Anyways, fast forward to my teen years and his young kid years and I can't stand the kid. He's such a crybaby even for his age and he doesn't like me for some reason. It started because he was taking toys from my dog and my dog started crying, so I yelled at the kid and he started to cry. I don't think I was being over the top and the kid definitely had to have someone discipline him. My mom loves him a lot and always talks about him but it pisses me off because it seems like she cares about him and his dad more than her own husband and only son. The kid does nothing but play video games on his xbox or my mom's iPad when he stays with us, Which I failed to mention is a very common occurrence. I'm starting to ramble but the main goal of this post was to find out if anyone feels the same way about any of their younger family members or if I'm just a complete asshole. \", \"Just found out my mum is pregnant.

My sisters and I are fairly close, and I'm worried that we won't be able to bond with our new sibling because of the huge age difference. We'll probably have all moved out in a few years (I've been planning on moving out this year) so we won't even get to have time to make those connections like we did with each other. It's just that it doesn't even feel real to me yet. Like if I was told that a relative or family friend was pregnant, not my own mother.\\n\\nIf anyone has any advice or experience with something like this I would be really grateful to hear it. Thank you. \", \"Worried about my daughter\\nI am in such a shit situation I don't know what to do. Myself and ex partner both have a child who is nearly 8 years old. We have been separated for a number of years and i see my daughter at weekends. The mother of my daughter isn't a bad person, she had a lot of bad stuff to deal with when she was younger. She basically smokes weed to shut out all the bad stuff and usually only does this when our daughter is in bed. A lot of the time she has threatened to kill herself and this has happened in front of my daughter I'm sure  which is so wrong. Today when I went round she started getting angry and I heard my daughter say to her 'if you don't stop I will run in front of a car when I'm older'. This has broke my heart completely and I don't know what to do. I hope my daughter doesn't mean this and is just copying her mum, but this is only gonna get worse as she gets older. Just to be clear her mum is a good person she just has issues and goes off the rails sometimes but I know for sure she loves her so much.

', 'My Story of Elder Abuse: Internet Romance Scams and the devastating consequences\\nI\\'m living a nightmare watching a woman 50 years younger than my 80-year-old father coerce him into marriage, manipulate him and taking his money all in the name of \"love\". The relationship started as Ghanaian romance scam (usembassy.gov/u-s-citizen-services/romance-scams/) and after we uncovered it was a male in Ghana pretending to be an American woman, it eventually led to a Ghanaian woman residing in Cuba, showing up at my father\\'s doorstep and coercing him into marriage two weeks later. The story is long, complex, and out of this world so I won\\'t go into it here. We\\'ve tried it all: FBI, USICE/immigration, State Dept., AARP, private investigators, the District Attorney, police, adult protective services, elder abuse attorney\\'s and filing for conservatorship. \\n\\nThe harsh reality I\\'m learning is though the crime is so blatantly obvious to everyone, I\\'m told over and over by the authorities that individuals have the right to abuse themselves. My father is showing serious signs of dementia but his executive functioning is still intact and we cannot get him to see a neuropsychologist without a long and painful court battle. \\n\\nTo the outside world, he comes across as just fine, but my normally mild-mannered, extremely rational and brilliant father has had explosive and violent episodes, personality changes, impulsive behavior, and has been unduly influenced and taken advantage of over an over again. He cannot see that people are lying to him even though the lies are later revealed to him. I\\'ve had a huge reality check just how powerful civil liberties to make bad decisions are in the USA along with the financial rights that coexist in marriage, no matter how corrupt. \\n\\nI\\'m not writing for advice since I know in my heart my father is not well and is no longer the father I know and love. What I want to know is if anyone else out there has experienced elder financial abuse in their family, and romance scams or partner abuse in particular. I want to hear your story. I am appalled that though financial elder abuse is rampant throughout the USA, and internet romance scams are only on the rise, there seems to be no major initiatives or policies to protect our vulnerable elders. \\n\\nThank you.\\n', 'Annoyed and I feel absolutely horrible about it\\nMy parents have recently recovered from some financial issues that caused them to move out of state. A little over a year ago, my father found a job back in the state where I currently live and has been staying at my place during the weeks when he works. As much as I love my parents though, sometimes I really struggle with sharing my limited space, i.e. a very small one bedroom apartment. \\n\\nWhat makes it even more difficult is the fact that I rarely ever know ahead of time when he\\'s coming and when he isn\\'t. And when he does come, he doesn\\'t knock. He just walks right in using the spare key that I came home to find was gone (without first being asked if it was okay to take) a while back. \\n\\nIt honestly makes me feel like I\\'m twelve again. I worked very hard to become independent and to have my own life and space and now... I don\\'t. I hadn\\'t even been on my own for a year when all of this started. \\n\\nI can\\'t say anything about it because my mother always downplays it by saying, \"You\\'ll be fine. We\\'re family.\" And the one time I even indirectly said something to my father, just by casually asking if he\\'d taken my spare key, I got a phone call from my mother saying that he was upset and essentially blamed me for them having to move to begin with. \\n\\nLong story short, I don\\'t know what to do.

Sometimes your family can be toxic and parents can be bad at their jobs, and it's very important to know when to say no, and walk away if you can. Especially if your culture and religion like this young girl tells you to never say no to your parents and obey their commands no matter what, It becomes very hard to go against them and say no, but it is essential to draw that line for your own safety.\\n\\nhttps://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/parents-daughter-abuse-forced-marriage-texas-cooking-oil-beat-bexar-county-maarib-al-hishmawi-a8274001.html\", \"Friends?\\nHi Reddit, so I recently moved to a new town (and by recently I mean about a year ago) and everything has been alright but I have a really hard time making friends.

I\\'m not sure but it coincides with the event and theres this subtle awkward \"accidentally\" distant attitude i feel coming from him, though I apologized for the kiss the very same day by text, that happened the morning after i slept in his bed at his party (we were 5 friends chatting in his bedroom until 6 am and the others left but we fell asleep spooning. madeout when we woke up. He has a girlfriend whos super jelly and absolutely doesnt want him to mess around, even tho he cheated on her a few weeks ago without telling. I have a boyfriend of 2 years that i love as well but we have a history of cheating on eachother and not knowing how to end this. \\nPOINT IS, i really wanna have sex with my friend right here. Once or whatever, i don\\'t really care, but i want my hots to go away and while hes only generically attractive, with very bland taste in women (im bisexual af and i don\\'t understand most straight men tastes alright) , hes really more than that and has some kinks i share. Plus, everyone has had some sort of relationship or hookup with eachother in the past in our friend group, and him and I are the only pair that hasn\\'t, so thats kind of anpther thing that makes the idea awkward. Not bright. I don\\'t know what to feel about this.\\nI slept in his bed again last night after an intimate party with our friends because the guest room was busy. At some point I was pretty sleepy and felt his hand on my panties (i didnt have pants on because its uncomfortable), but he was well asleep. I gradually felt a tingling growing round there and it slightly woke me up, and after some time he was starting to give me hand stuff, leaned in to kiss me, and then - maybe it was because i didnt bring my toothbrush and had bad breath, i hope not for the love of god, a few seconds after that he removed his hand from what i literally had been dreaming -fuck my life for making me that horny, grabbed my boob a little and then got his hand back to him and fell asleep. I dont know why he stopped, and thats the most awlward thing : what could that mean? If we had full on sex we could both agree it was wanted but a mistake, and reveal sexual tension between us. But right now it looks like i dont really attract him at all, but he still likes some intimacy, just not with me. Is that your analysis as well? What do you guys read in this? \\nIm well known for liking girls and have  short jaw length cherry red hair. A very cute face but Basically not your typical bombshell. Maybe that\\'s what differences me from other girls he would dig having sex with? \\nOtherwise...im just lost. I have no way of finding out if hes attracted to me in the slighest at the moment , and if we\\'re not meant to bang, i really feel like we lost this kinda vibe in the past months where he would randomly text me every few days and have long, intimate convos about feelings and things happening in our lives, even if were not best friends, we got along well. (We dont really hang out alone together though, that might have happened once or twice only) I really hope i wont lose this definitely from those two awkward, unwanted situations(?) , it would really suck cause I really like him as a friend.

He was dating b and I's friend (named 'e') for a long period, and tldr, he was extremely abusive and raped her multiple times during their relationship. B was friends with E. Recently, B decided to begin dating S (after lying about meeting him repeatedly over a couple days period). I cut off the friendship but she kept trying to speak to me as I didn;t think she got my point of not wanting to be her friend but I think I've made it more clear in recent messages. It turns out B may have lied about a lot of things (to the point of manipulating me about my trauma, telling me certain people said things about me and didn't like me. she says they definitely said it but the people say otherwise so I don't know who to believe. she has extreme 'stories' that i don't know if are true anymore either). B thinks that me cutting off the friendship is to an extent not fair as it's not my business to make her choose between her now boyfriend and me. I disagree - she is dating our friend's rapist (well not her friend anymore) and I find it disgusting and I can't be friends with her due to this. \\n\\nMostly, I am paranoid that I am.. well.. wrong.

In her defense, her two sisters are 500 pounds apiece will both probably die before they reach 60, so she just wants me to be healthy and live long. But she\\'s not helping. She\\'s only making me want to cry into a Chipotle bowl.\\n* She liked comparing me to my best friend in high school (\"Why can\\'t you be more like her? She studies and gets good grades!\") Still does sometimes.\\n* To this day, she pesters me about my lack of religion. I remember when I was 11 and didn\\'t want to go to Sunday School, she was like \"Do you want to be a heathen and go to hell?\" A couple years ago, she told me \"I just want you to go to Heaven when you die.\" She even pestered me a week ago about having demons in my head.\\n* I thought I could confide in her about my sexuality but she quickly shot me down with \"How do you know? You\\'ve never been on a date before. That doesn\\'t mean you\\'re bi/gay!\" She also told me I am asexual and she\\'s pretty much gaslighted me about my sexuality to the point where I don\\'t know whether I am gay or straight anymore.\\n* I was diagnosed with Aspergers and ADHD when I was a kid and she\\'s basically used that diagnosis to keep me in a little bubble. I didn\\'t get drivers\\' license until 18, didn\\'t get my first job until 20, and I\\'m still perpetually single... all because my mom has used my diagnoses as a crutch. She still does, and after the accident, I don\\'t fucking blame her!\\n\\nWhenever I try to tell him about the things my mom says, he says things like \"What\\'s wrong with motivating you to get better grades?\" or \"Your mom doesn\\'t want you to end up like your sisters that she is going to bury because they\\'re 500 pounds.\" My mom is my bully, and he is her apologist.\\n\\nI don\\'t how much of this (if anything) constitutes abuse, but my dad doesn\\'t buy any of it and blames it on \"liberal millennial indoctrinated safe-space snowflake bullshit... abuse is broken bones, black eyes and cigarette burns on arms.\" He goes on about how he and mom have done everything for me and how there is something in my sick, twisted mind that is confusing \"constructive criticism\" with \"abuse.\"\\n\\nDeep down, I am beginning to resent my parents, because they *have* done everything for me, sheltered me and spoiled me to the point where I don\\'t know how the world outside my little bubble works.

Some just stopped contacting me since they now live far away living in dorms and such..and others I dropped because they were fake. Sometimes I do sort of regret it, but that\\'s only because of the loneliness and boredom I feel home alone on a weeknight. I\\'m currently taking a year off and I only have one close friend. I\\'ve only known this friend for a year but we got along so well. We had soo many things in common. But now I feel like he\\'s super fake. For ex, he talks crap about his \"friends\" but then posts photos and acts all nice and friendly around them. When he talks about them with me, it genuinely sounds like he hates them and says he never wants to hangout with them..but then does??. Not only that, but nowadays whenever we hang all he seems to do is complain and judge other people. Like, at first it use to be ok..but now it\\'s all the time. It\\'s so toxic and just a cheap form of communication imo. He\\'s also always late whenever we schedule a meetup. Not once was he ever on time, sometimes he makes me wait an hour because he took his time to get ready when he knows that I\\'m waiting for him. We also never get to do what I want to do anymore because he\\'s \"lazy\". For ex, I really wanted to go to this cute cafe and he also did too..but then on the day of he was taking so long to get ready we ended up not having time to go. We only get to do what I want if he\\'s benefitting from it. Just thinking about this makes me wanna go to him right now and let out all my anger at his face. I do confront him, but it\\'s almost as if he forgets. I would tell him that I hate it when he makes fun of my body or rubs whatevers on his hands on my shirt as if it\\'s a tissue but then a couple weeks later he\\'ll do it. ugh. Just recently too..he was telling me about his cousin and how she literally talks crap about everyone which led to me asking if she ever talked about me. He said yes and she basically called me weird just because of my face shape. I know it\\'s nothing serious but it made me mad because I\\'m super self conscious about it. But what made me even more mad was the fact that my so called \"friend\" didn\\'t even stick up for me. He didn\\'t tell her to stop or anything. \\n\\nSorry that this turned into a rant, but I really wanted some advice. I feel so lonely. When he hangout I feel as I have to be this super fun person because he seems to talk about how his other friends are so fun when he hangs out with me. It wasn\\'t always like this..maybe we\\'re growing apart from each other, I don\\'t know, but I\\'m purposely taking a break from him for two weeks..we scheduled a meetup for his bday but idk how that\\'ll go.

I dont know why I continue trying to talk to her, but maybe it would have been better for us if it had end there, and eventually she came around and asked to go out with her, we didnt talk at all about that, she just gave me a note saying why she did that, wich honestly didnt tell much except saying she has depression and didnt know what she was doing...She said she always hurts everyone so she cut me out. Years later, we didnt talk that much as before, but were still really good friends, then I started to notice that me or other friends counldn say anything to her if it was something that upset her. Sometimes it was so stupid that she got mad at me because I didnt agree with her opinion over an actor... She would rage in games with everyone, and stop talking.. now the part that hurts me like hell is that she would cut us all out of her life, for like weeks, then come back like nothing happen. She would never tell me whats wrong, if I tried to talk about more serious stuff she would step away again. Eventually I got tired, and told her that we couldnt go on like this.\\n \\nSo I stoped talking to her, 2 months later I decided to give another shot, what happen was exactly the same. So I stoped talking again, and I though it was for good, we only talked when we were with all our friends etc. Then I learnt a few months later that she wanted to commit suicide. She actually tried it, said her mom, and was admited to an hospital. I was heart broken, thinking about losing her forever took over my jugdment... So I went to the hospital, and we talk normally. Then after she got out we had a conversation, face to face, about her stoping doing all that to me, she said she was going to try, and promised me, PROMISED ME that she would tell me when something was wrong, or when she would like to be left alone so I didnt worry as much, and that she would talk to me if I ever said something wrong about her. Everything was going great, amazing really. I could tell she was better with her medicine and all, but that only last 3 months. Now she had a problem with a boy she likes or something, pretended that everything was ok, despited her answers said otherwise, and started ignoring me. I was mad and said, some things never change, and she responded to me saying she was a lost cause. I wrote a whole text to her saying I want to be her friend, but that will only work as long as shes honest with me and stops pushing me away... she wanst answered yet. she also never said to me that shes sorry she hurts me, even thoug I say that to her when I hurt her.

And while I've nothing at all against Bill Burr - I actually think he's hilarous! - talking to her is like trying to talk back to one of his on-stage rants, understand?!  Because he's ranting to be funny, but she actually means what she says.\\n\\nI love this sister, and am closer to her than many of the five sisters I have, but I'm beginning to point this out to her because I don't think she realizes the way she sounds.  Almost everything is said in a confrontational or defensive tone of voice!?!?!  And I just don't understand *WHY?*  Should I suggest therapy?  Anti-depressants, or anti-psychotics?  A shrink?\", 'How To Get Over The Pain\\nI ended/lost a friendship with a best friend of 14 years. She was really good to me, once upon a time; I was declared disabled and lost my house and she let me move in with her and her husband to get back on my feet. For all she knew I could\\'ve been the Thing That Never Leaves. But I lived with her for about 9 months, got a job, and got my own place.\\n\\nShe\\'s Mormon, and during this time had her first kid. She insists everything\\'s fine, no worries (because she had to, I think; Mormons put a lot of pressure on their women.) But things start getting distant between us, and this is only something I notice in hindsight.\\n\\nI got the greenlight to publish a book, and she offered to typeset because she had InDesign. Okay, are you sure? Yes. You\\'re sure? Yes. Okay, cool, thanks, that\\'s awesome, I don\\'t have to do it myself cause I don\\'t have the program or know how to use it. I give her a deadline for October and pay her.\\n\\nWell, I bust my ass on this book for months. It\\'s the most important thing I\\'ve ever done with my life and it means everything to me. And 4 days before deadline, I find out she\\'s only done up to Chapter 5 on the book. Which basically means she fucked off for 4 months, and did nothing, which means she\\'s going to do a rush job. That automatically means more mistakes that I have to depend on her to fix, which she didn\\'t in the first place, and she\\'s totally shattered my trust.\\n\\nI freaked the fuck out on her and had a hysterical meltdown. It was bad, and I don\\'t make any excuses for it. I was really shitty to her. I panicked and thought she was going to hold the book hostage with procrastination, and I had no way to get the files from her. I\\'d put myself up shit creek, because it was too late for me to learn InDesign.\\n\\nWell, she was defensive, to say the least. She said I don\\'t need to police her time, and I should\\'ve known this is how she works. I felt like she was trying to gaslight me, so I posted on Facebook about the situation without naming names and asked other professional artist friends if this was appropriately professional behavior. They said no. That REALLY pissed her off, because a few days later I got a letter.\\n\\nIn it she said she\\'d done all this stuff for me (let you live in my house, put up with your shit etc.), said I didn\\'t want her to have her dream family and dream life (she was doing horse archery competitions and I didn\\'t want her to do that, either, apaprently), my shitty upbringing made me dysfunctional, and she gave me an ultimatum that I had to make a change. Until then she said she didn\\'t want me to talk to her, and she was \"closing her door to me.\"\\n\\nI felt supremely judged, i.e. \"My perfect Mormon family was NEVER dysfunctional, so obviously you\\'re the problem here, as a dysfunctional person yourself. Not me.\" I felt like I\\'d been un-forgiven, \"Hey, remember all that stuff I said I forgave you for? Surprise!\" And I felt horrible, like I could never apologize enough, and that from here on out I was going to be scapegoated because I was the fucked up one and she was the squeaky-clean Mormon.\\n\\nI left her alone for about 6 week, not talking to her like she said. Then I reached out, apologized, and asked if we could talk in person without anymore nastygram letters. And this, to be honest, is where I\\'m most mad at myself, because I wish I\\'d just cut things off the minute she started talking like her shit didn\\'t stink. Instead, we met, and she said my apology made her angry because it sounded like I\\'d disregarded her letter. I was a bit taken aback, because the letter sounded like one of those venting things where you\\'re supposed to write them but not send them, and instead she was acting like she\\'d sent me gospel I needed to abide by.\\n\\nI said I felt like I was always going to be the wrong one, no matter what. She said I came from a dysfunctional family, compared me to a fear-agressive dog, and said \"Which problem is more in need of fixing?\" So in other words, yeah. Yeah, I was always going to be wrong, because no matter what she did I was always going to be worse because of my background. She said I\\'d declared her typesetting \"a failure\" before I even saw it, and insisted she\\'d done a good job. I told her there were obvious mistakes, like misaligned tabs and words running into illustrations, and she said she\\'d made the deadline and reiterated that once again, I should have known she procrastinates. I told for someone who had gone to church for twenty plus fucking years, she didn\\'t know how forgiveness works because Jesus doesn\\'t say \"Forgive thine enemies, until you\\'ve got a whole pile of ammunition and can really use that shit against them.\" (I\\'m agnostic.) She said she\\'d already apologized (implication being that I couldn\\'t forgive) and when I told her it felt like she could never make a mistake, she screamed \"YOU JUST WANT ME TO GROVEL!\" and stormed off. Her husband came out, yelled at me, and told me to \"handle my shit\" and called me a toddler. Previously he\\'d admitted to me in private that he wouldn\\'t hire his own wife for a job because of her lack of professionalism.\\n\\nThe next day I wrote her saying I needed my book files, to make sure the publisher could make corrections. And once that was good to go, I told her I was glad we weren\\'t friends anymore, because all her judgement was off my shoulders. She said she would have fixed the typesetting mistakes if I\\'d just told her, DURING the time she\\'d explicitly said not to talk to her, so it was my fault again for not getting things corrected. I was arrogant, you see, and she said she wasn\\'t angry, just that she felt sorry for me, and told me \"You are your family.\"\\n\\nI am genuinely glad to not be friends with her anymore. She made the worst of assumptions about me, turned on me when SHE fucked up and made it MY fault, and got hyper-defensive and toxic  in her behavior while simultaneously calling me dysfunctional. Hindsight is 20/20, and I feel like she had too much to do with her baby, couldn\\'t say no, and resented the task in the first place. She said she didn\\'t come home every night and think \"I\\'m not going to work on typesetting tonight, just to piss off Plethora\" as if good intentions can\\'t pave the road to hell and hurt people. I said we were shitty to each other, but she won\\'t admit fault at all. And I know I don\\'t need a judgemental perfectionist in my life.\\n\\nBut I\\'m still hurt, and outraged, and angry. I keep finding myself having arguments in my head when I\\'m driving or trying to fall asleep. I\\'m furious that everything became conditional suddenly, that I was retroactively unforgiven, and treated in the worst way by someone who sees themselves as morally superior. Winter is just finishing up so I haven\\'t really been able to get out fo ra Meetup or something, but it\\'s hard not to fee like you can\\'t make a relationship work when a 14 year one just went down the drain because of something you did. I\\'ve read some other Reddits, where people have lost friendships over things like weddings, which make me feel a bit better. Bitching someone out because they dropped the ball on your creative work suddenly doesn\\'t seem so unreasonable. But I\\'m mad I tried to make things work even after a bunch of red flags telling me I should\\'ve known better, and STILL ended up feeling like shit because I \"apologized wrong\" and \"wasn\\'t good enough.\" I miss who my friend used to be, not who she is now. I feel like the only thing that\\'s going to take away the pain is time, but it\\'s been months and I still feel the same way, and feel like I\\'m justified in never trusting anyone again, because if 14 fucking years aren\\'t enough, what is? How do you get over the pain of things ending so badly when part of it was your responsibility, too?\\n\\n', 'My father may have been a monster after all...\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ll try to make this as short as I can\\n\\nI am a 32/F both my parents have passed my mom as recently as 12/2016. My father was up in age when I was born. My mom was wife number 5 and much younger. So when he passed in 2013 it was sad but he lived till his nineties. My parents each had two kids from previous marriages that are much older then me. My mom got sick and then was dying for a year. I was her caregiver 100% and she lived with me. I worked two jobs had no days off and was a P/T nanny as well. Which made her so happy to have in the house cause she loved babies. My bro and sister are human garbage. They did nothing for her when she was dying, made life horrible for me, disliked my care for her just all around horrible people who pushed me to the brink of suicide. I cut all ties when she died moved to another part of the state and got a promotion. Iâ\\x80\\x99m doing alright now and itâ\\x80\\x99s only been a little over a year. \\n\\nSo now I had a brother from my dads marriage but he died in a car wreck in 07. My sister from my dads side is all the family I have left. I love her dearly but she has mental issues that are severe. Depression, schizophrenia, anxiety. We live in different states and I tried to get her to move to my state and she Wont she likes where she is. She lives independently and goes to a day program so she manages ok.\\n\\nRecently she has been upset at my cutting ties with my half siblings her step siblings. I told her I would have no problem with her continuing contact but I would not. Hell my cunt of a shitty sister tried to borrow money from her the majority of the times she called her but still I canâ\\x80\\x99t stop her she is a 50yr old woman.\\n\\nBut now my fragile sister is starting to not do well she is recalling abuse from when she was a teen. Gang rape at 13 multiple rapes in high school etc.  and she said our dad did nothing and noticed nothing\\n\\nNow I know this could be her illness at play but....I think I believe her.  She got sick or I should say her schizophrenia came to the front lines in her early 20s after she graduated college and had a pretty damn good job. I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t even born yet but my mom was in the picture.\\n\\n(My mom and her were very close) \\nWhen my sister had her breakdown she described horrible rape and  abuse in the middle of delusions and episodes. My mom said my dad thought it was her sickness but as my mom put it the way she described it happening it originated somewhere. Whether delusions morphed her memories my mom thought it happened to her.\\n\\nSo now this sister only has me to vent to. I tried to call her case manager but as she is an adult and hasnâ\\x80\\x99t been hospitalized in decades she wonâ\\x80\\x99t let me speak to her. Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to call her day program and try to speak to someone about her seeing a rape counselor or something along wit her regular treatment.\\n\\nIn a way I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to deal with something this heavy again and I know thatâ\\x80\\x99s selfish I lost years of myself helping care for my dying father then 100% for my mom I was pushed to the brink of my own sanity\\n\\nAnd then there is the fact that I think my father did do nothing. I was his favorite and I know I was. He never hit me and my mom but he was verbally abusive. But he favorited me cause I am the most like him. He valued education and ambition and I think he felt my sister failed him being sick along with my brother. He acted as a father and I have good memories of him but he wasnâ\\x80\\x99t exactly a emotional or loving person to my mom or at times me. But I guess I got the little he had in him. \\n\\nNow Iâ\\x80\\x99m starting to wonder if he was a sociopath or fuck a damn monster. \\n\\nAfter my brother who would be said sisters full brother died in what we thought was a regular car accident I found out it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t. He was on pills and had an addiction and was telling people  this shit will kill me. And from the police report witnesses state he just veered into a pole never hit anyone or anything. Just went into a tree.\\n\\nMy fathers first two children ended up like they did and then there is is me. Without my mom would I have been something different? \\n\\nWhile I pulled myself out of the hole I thought I was in, I havenâ\\x80\\x99t done well in dating or making friends in my new city. before my parents illnesses I was good at it.\\n\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m afraid Iâ\\x80\\x99m doing ok with all these losses because I am like him. \\n\\nThrough my job Iâ\\x80\\x99m booking sessions with a therapist but im still scared to pick up the phone when my sister calls\\n\\nI know I sound really selfish\\n\\n', 'Trying to start a dialogue with a friend and seeing it blow up in my face\\nHi Everyone, \\nFirst off, thank you to everyone here. I\\'ve been a long time reader but never posted. This is yet another post regarding a friend and the problems associated.\\n\\nBasically, me and this guy have been friends since college, we\\'re both in our mid-30s and entering into the next phase of our respective lives. We\\'ve always had a contentious friendship, many fights, many core disagreements, and often general dislike for one another. The solution to dealing with this has always been along the line of this: it\\'s R, and he\\'s an asshole, so what can you expect!\\n\\nSo the story in question goes like this... we\\'re at a mutual friends wedding and he goes out of his way to ignore me and my gf, now my fiance, coming over to the group we were with and asking a question to a couple people then leaving, also practically walking by us without saying hi. It was only until I said something that he acknowledged us, which set my fiance up in flames. A few weeks later we got engaged and I texted all my friends, including R, individually with a semi copied/pasted message. It was short and sweet, but 100% honest. He doesn\\'t reply, I left the country for vacation, and I never got his text. Turns out he did reply but more on that in a minute. \\n\\nI was upset, I sent him an email that was part deconstructive to our friendship, partly selfish, but also completely honest. I told him my feelings, how I contemplated why he didn\\'t respond but ultimately decided that i didn\\'t care and that I didn\\'t need someone in my life who was going to treat me that way. By telling him these were my feelings and repeating that I wanted him to realize I was upset and I wanted to open a discussion. I never said directly \"I don\\'t want you as a friend\" or \"you\\'re not invited to my wedding\" but that is what he took from it. I wanted to open a dialogue, but he got really upset and angry. Also turns out he did respond to my text, a week later and said that the original text never sent, but that since his wife is pregnant he wouldn\\'t be able to make the wedding, which is completely fine with me because the wedding is in another country. I just hated his response, it was cold and not something a friend should send to another friend regarding a wedding.\\n\\nI called him out and wanted to make him see that by my standards he was not acting like a friend, but also neither was I. I had not put much effort into the friendship either. But I did say that I wanted to say these things rather than say nothing with the hopes that we could find common ground and build a foundation for something to grow in the future, which he completely ignored. \\n\\nI honestly have no idea what to do. I fear he is going to turn all our mutual friends against me, and I don\\'t know how I am able to handle that, or if I can even handle that. My life is in a great place, but my friendships are shit, and that hurts more than I could ever imagine. To put more on top of it, his wife was having issues with a pregnancy, which he said were serious. But I heard from a mutual friend that he said she was fine. So I don\\'t know how to react to that. I honestly don\\'t know where to go from here. My fiance, my rock, my saving grace, is unfortunately traveling for work this month and really crazy busy. She owns her own business so it\\'s important for her to pound the pavement and get sales, so I really don\\'t want her to be burdened by my own bullshit. \\n\\nI can send anyone the email discussion in a PDF if you want to read it. Hopefully someone can help.', 'Whatâ\\x80\\x99s the worst thing a friend has ever said to you?\\n I have two stories. \\n\\n1. This was a few years ago. It was near Christmas time. I had gotten my friend a $300 iPod. I was planning on giving it to her the week before Christmas. So a week prior to me giving her the present, I take her to the movies. I worked at the movie theater so the ticket was free. But I got her a few pins we sell, we got a photo at the photo booth, and we got concessions. The total was probably around $50. When I got to paying for the popcorn and candy, my coworker said it was nice of me to pay for all of it. I jokingly said â\\x80\\x9cthis is her Christmas present.â\\x80\\x9d My friend said that it was the cheapest present. Should have taken the iPod back after that, just to be petty. But she had been in a serious car accident that year so I reconsidered that. \\n\\n2. This one was recent. We live in different countries. She texted me, after not speaking for three days due to busy schedules, about how Iâ\\x80\\x99m lucky to not have a health issue. I thought she was just upset with her life. But she was evidently mad at me. She made it seem like I donâ\\x80\\x99t deserve my Masters degree because I didnâ\\x80\\x99t work as hard for mine since I didnâ\\x80\\x99t have to overcome any health issues. The worst thing she said was that I keep bragging about my life, but â\\x80\\x9cnobody cares about you.â\\x80\\x9d She tried apologizing maybe five minutes later but I ignored it. She somehow assumed I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be angry. After many texts, I told her that I was upset and that I needed space. She got upset that I was upset about what she said. Just because you are sick and your life feels like shit, that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t give you the right to say something like that to someone and still expect to be friends. Two weeks later she told me how my happy posts were annoying her and she hated it. Blocked her without replying. \\n\\nSometimes we need to let things go. The people who are your friends will never say stuff like this. ', 'My family might break apart...\\nSorry this is a long post.\\nYes I know this is common thing sadly. But I donâ\\x80\\x99t want it to, 12 years my family have been together.\\n\\nJust to start off,\\nThere is me, my brother, my dad and mum.\\n\\nSo my dad has anger issues. His parents never told him it was wrong so he has been like this all his life. Our mum is his second wife because his first wife divorced him for all the reasons Iâ\\x80\\x99m about to mention.\\nWe only listen to him because he rules out of fear, he isnâ\\x80\\x99t teaching us anything, and is a bad influence on us. When he gets annoyed he yells really loudly on purpose for everyone to hear (including our neighbours) then drives off for an hour. Heâ\\x80\\x99s always threatening to me and my brother, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99LL KICK YOU IN THE FACEâ\\x80\\x9d, â\\x80\\x9cYOUâ\\x80\\x99LL END UP IN HOSPITAL.â\\x80\\x9d\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ve despised him for about 3 weeks and itâ\\x80\\x99s actually a lot better when he drives off and vanishes. Problem is, he makes 80% of our money.\\n\\nMy brother is slowly becoming like my dad.Iâ\\x80\\x99m trying to help him, my mum is trying to help him but it isnâ\\x80\\x99t working. I believe he can still change because heâ\\x80\\x99s still young (12). He yells at our parents trying to prove he is right all the time. Problem is, he wonâ\\x80\\x99t listen to us unless our dad threatens him and scares him into stopping. Heres the big problem, he is a messy person and our mum is a very tidy person, she tells him all the time clean up but he says, â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99ll do it laterâ\\x80\\x9d, but never actually does it. So my mum and brother argue often about this. He says he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t care about who he is becoming, but I know he does. Despite all the tension between me and my brother I still love him very much. \\n\\nMy mum is the only reason our family is still together. She ends up stopping dad from slapping/threatening us and is the one that teaches me and my brother right from wrong. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s basically carrying our whole family and I feel bad about it. I love her very much and I feel so much empathy for her. She was a good daughter and this is the life she grew up for. Itâ\\x80\\x99s sad, really.\\n\\nAnd me, I was also becoming like my dad, but ever since Mid 2017 Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had a fear of me or my brother becoming like him in the future. Iâ\\x80\\x99m using my words, Iâ\\x80\\x99m trying not to yell. Iâ\\x80\\x99m trying not to walk off after every arguement so I can tame my temper. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve slipped a few times, but this fear is actually changing me for the better.\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m telling my brother not to answer back to our parents but he wonâ\\x80\\x99t listen. Iâ\\x80\\x99m trying to help my mum because I feel sorry for her. So recently, itâ\\x80\\x99s me and my mum trying to stop my brother from yelling at us, stopping our dad threating/slapping us. Iâ\\x80\\x99m trying to get my brother to see the future like me. \\n\\nSo just yesterday, my brother made a light-hearted joke to my dad and he got mad and slapped him. Later that evening, our mum asked him why he did that. So he drove off and came back at 1am. After this, our mum and dad havenâ\\x80\\x99t spoken to each other. This morning my brother keeps arguing his point to our mum, I try to support her.\\nMy dad has done nothing. All he did was wake up, drove off and come back at 7:30pm to sleep, then he drove off again.\\nSo just a few hours ago, my mum tells my brother to clean up. This causes a arguement. I support mum, but my brother wonâ\\x80\\x99t stop yelling. I told him to stop 3 times but he told me, â\\x80\\x9cYou donâ\\x80\\x99t have the authority to tel me to do anythingâ\\x80\\x9d.  After this my mum asks me, â\\x80\\x9cwhat should we do now?â\\x80\\x9d Then I messaged my brother and things have been solved between us. \\n\\nThats too much arguements for just 2 days, donâ\\x80\\x99t you think? \\nAnd my mum is right, what can we do? \\n\\nThereâ\\x80\\x99s too much problems with all of us, and weâ\\x80\\x99re all depending on each other so itâ\\x80\\x99s not easy. My mum wouldâ\\x80\\x99ve divorced dad long ago if she had the money. \\nI want me, my brother and mum to live together peacefully away from the bad influence of our dad.\\n\\nWe havenâ\\x80\\x99t called the authorities because my mum is afraid of what will happen to our dad.\\nWe havenâ\\x80\\x99t got outside help because our parents think itâ\\x80\\x99s embarassing.\\n\\nSo, what choices do we have?\\n\\n', 'Friend slipping up at work. I talked to her and now sheâ\\x80\\x99s creating a bad environment for me.\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ll call my ex friend Mary.  We met at work.  I really valued our friendship because itâ\\x80\\x99s hard for me to make friends.  I had a few hurt me in the past, so I became guarded.  Plus, I had to leave behind true ones when I moved away from my hometown 3 years ago.  About a year and a half ago, she started dating a new guy.  They seemed to have an ok relationship.  After a year of dating, they started having problems.  Mary spent every lunch hour complaining about him the entire time.  She stopped asking me how I was, always steering the conversation toward her bf.  I tried to be there for her, hugging her and reassuring her sheâ\\x80\\x99ll be ok.  She would be like, yeah I know but...then continue complaining about him.  She admitted to nagging him, and he eventually got sick of it and broke up with her.  She was a mess, crying at work, sometimes not even coming in.  I felt bad for her but it was the same thing over and over all the time, and I ran out of stuff to say.  Not to be offensive toward women (I am one, after all), but being the environment it is, word about Maryâ\\x80\\x99s breakup traveled fast, and all our coworkers went up to Mary to comfort her. She leaned heavily on four of them, who often came up to her desk and asked if she wanted to talk.  Mary stopped hanging out with me and started spending a lot of time with them.  Mary would say yes when they offered to talk to her at work and theyâ\\x80\\x99d talk for like a half hour or longer (my desk is next to hers, so thatâ\\x80\\x99s how I knew).  I would also see Mary huddled in the hallways talking to these women a lot.  It affected Maryâ\\x80\\x99s work.  She started taking on less work (claiming she was overwhelmed) and not being around (she would go off to find one of the women), so the rest of us would be left to answer her calls or speak to her clients on her behalf.  Our boss is very hands off and is a poor manager so he has no idea, and my coworkers just excuse Mary because they feel bad for her and donâ\\x80\\x99t wanna tell our boss.  But because she and I handle certain cases that only she and I know how to deal with, itâ\\x80\\x99s usually me whoâ\\x80\\x99s left to pick up the extra slack.  This went on for 3 months.  Honestly, if she wasnâ\\x80\\x99t a friend, I might gone to our boss, but I decided to talk to Mary about it.  It didnâ\\x80\\x99t go well. She got defensive, denied that she was slipping up, and accused me of being a bad friend cuz I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t there for her during this difficult time.  I tried to point out examples of her slipping up and she denied it again.  I also told her she wasnâ\\x80\\x99t there for me when my friend committed suicide or my dad had a health scare which left him disabled.  She just responded that she was left in so much despair from the breakup that she wasnâ\\x80\\x99t capable of being unselfish enough to be a friend.  We both walked away mad.  She started ignoring me completely.  I didnâ\\x80\\x99t think I was wrong but I still felt bad.  As this was around Christmas time, I decided to extend an olive branch by giving her a small Christmas gift and card that just said I was sorry and I hoped she had a merry Christmas.  The next day, she said thanks and weâ\\x80\\x99d talk soon.  The day after that, she was back to ignoring me.  Now she doesnâ\\x80\\x99t speak to me or even look at me, just pretends Iâ\\x80\\x99m not there.  I canâ\\x80\\x99t say for sure, but I get the feeling that she told our coworkers about our conversation (I havenâ\\x80\\x99t told anyone at work about it) cuz I now get the cold shoulder from some of them, too, when just the day before, we were all ok.  They, in front of me, make a show of hugging Mary and offer food to each other but not to me.  I even got a dirty look from one of the women, too.  Sigh, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what to do.  Any advice?', \"Is my friend acting dumb?\\nSo, my friend has been dating this guy for a couple of years. Not only did he cheat on her but he got another woman pregnant. She found nudes of other girls on his phone. They broke up, got back together, etc. Hes been trying to prove hes changed to her... blah blah. \\nMy friend told me to create a fake profile of an attractive woman and talk to him and he unfortunately failed.

A little backstory, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve known her almost 7 years. We met through our boyfriends (theyâ\\x80\\x99re our exes now) and we used to do double dates and a lot of couple-y activities like roller skating or sleepovers and things like that. She and I stayed friends despite the break-ups with our boyfriends at the time. But our friendship has been a little rocky because of her busy schedule. She usually works 40-60 hours in any given week and she even lived in another city for 18 months so I didnâ\\x80\\x99t always get to see her or hang out as much as I would have liked. But weâ\\x80\\x99ve kept in touch through social media. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve always expressed a desire to hang out more, like doing road trips or daycations or local activities like concerts but sheâ\\x80\\x99s either too busy or financially strapped to do it. So typically we either see each other on our birthdays and thatâ\\x80\\x99s about it.\\n\\nThe problem Iâ\\x80\\x99m having is that sheâ\\x80\\x99s married to this guy she met 4 years ago and Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been single forÂ\\xa0 5 years. I have a FWB [25M] who Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been in a â\\x80\\x9csituationshipâ\\x80\\x9d with for 18 months. I kept that a secret from her because itâ\\x80\\x99s not a real relationship and Iâ\\x80\\x99m not sure if itâ\\x80\\x99ll ever become one. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s met him recently through a fluke of bumping into each other while he and I were out at a store. Ever since she became aware of his existence, sheâ\\x80\\x99s been pressuring me to plan â\\x80\\x9cdouble datesâ\\x80\\x9d like going to the drive-ins to see the new Star Wars Movie or coming over to their house for Redbox movies and dinner. I already told her thatâ\\x80\\x99s not really the type of relationship that I have. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve mentioned the idea of all 4 of us hanging out to him casually to see if heâ\\x80\\x99d be interested but he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t want to do it.Â\\xa0 When I told her that I rather she and I just go to the movies together or girlsâ\\x80\\x99 night over at my place, she said she canâ\\x80\\x99t because she wants to spend time with her husband when sheâ\\x80\\x99s not busy working. I feel like sheâ\\x80\\x99s not really going to spend time with me unless I give in and do â\\x80\\x9ccouplesâ\\x80\\x9d activities.\\n\\nI just feel like she and I are in such different places in our lives and have different values when it comes to friendship that it'd be better to end it now than to continue trying to spend time with someone who doesn't seem to want to do things just the two of us.

Their reasoning? I had vented at a few points saying I wished he was dead (normally after he would call me drunk and call me a whore and talk shit on my mother who raised me since birth).

One night I was going home early and he said â\\x80\\x98no youâ\\x80\\x99re staying at mine tonightâ\\x80\\x99, but within half an hour met some guy and said he was going home with him instead- and that didnâ\\x80\\x99t even end up happening because the guy had a boyfriend, so he ditched me for no reason. He doesnâ\\x80\\x99t even text me, because apparently heâ\\x80\\x99s a bad communicator. On the flip side he constantly refers to me as â\\x80\\x98one of his best friendsâ\\x80\\x99, tells me he loves me and wants me to be his maid of honour one day.\\n\\nHe had a potential STI scare recently and asked if Iâ\\x80\\x99d go to the clinic with him. I ran out of my house and across the city to sit with him for 4 hours, didnâ\\x80\\x99t even have time to brush my teeth! While we were waiting I told him this was the first time weâ\\x80\\x99ve hung out outside of a club, and he said â\\x80\\x98itâ\\x80\\x99s not my fault Iâ\\x80\\x99m busyâ\\x80\\x99. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t show it but I was really disappointed. Heâ\\x80\\x99s a student (as am I), not the president. He hangs out with his other friends constantly, stays at their house for a week at a time OR MORE, but has the nerve to tell me heâ\\x80\\x99s too busy for me.\\n\\nA week later he invited me to the club again and we left and walked to the bus stop together. He got on his bus and left me alone and drunk, again. Itâ\\x80\\x99s also strange because heâ\\x80\\x99d always invite me to stay at his after nights out, but that randomly stopped a couple of months ago. Anyway, this time I had enough and ignored his messages after that. He then invited me to the cinema and I said yes. On the day I saw that he was with his other friends instead. He called me at night and said he was â\\x80\\x98tired and sickâ\\x80\\x99 but we could meet 2 days later. I just said â\\x80\\x98okâ\\x80\\x99 because I didnâ\\x80\\x99t want to confront him and fall out. \\n\\nOn the day we were meeting he text me at 5pm and asked â\\x80\\x98are you still up for the cinema?â\\x80\\x99 and following advice from my friends, I said â\\x80\\x98no thanksâ\\x80\\x99 and told him itâ\\x80\\x99s unbelievable that after everything hes done he chose to blow off hanging out with me to hang out with other friends, and lied about it. I also said heâ\\x80\\x99s not busy, heâ\\x80\\x99s just a shit friend. He said he agrees that Iâ\\x80\\x99m a better friend than him but he never hangs out with anyone sober and heâ\\x80\\x99s trying his best. He said he was making an effort to match his actions to his words by spending time with me alone. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t reply. \\n\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s been 4 days and we havenâ\\x80\\x99t spoken since. Heâ\\x80\\x99s been with his other friends the whole time and frankly I donâ\\x80\\x99t think heâ\\x80\\x99s bothered. I know it sounds dramatic but Iâ\\x80\\x99ve barely slept since. Iâ\\x80\\x99m only getting 3 hours of sleep a night and Iâ\\x80\\x99m really sad and canâ\\x80\\x99t stop thinking about the situation. I thought we were gonna be friends forever. I love him and want him in my life but everyone says Iâ\\x80\\x99ve given him too many chances. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been thinking about apologising and making up, if nothing else at least just so I can feel better and start sleeping again. But I donâ\\x80\\x99t know how it will be received or if anything will change. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what to do but this situation is killing me and I regret causing it in the first place.

I would like to document our meeting with a few candid photos only if you are comfortable, if not, a conversation does the trick! \\n\\nGetting to Know a Stranger is all inclusive and strives to get to know all walks of life. I welcome all ages, gender identities, races, religious views, economic status.â\\x80¦. you know every type of Human! \\n\\nI know that in my own life I have felt extremely alone and isolated in my own mind many times, and have felt that there is NO one who understands what I am going through. What I started to notice was through my own travels and tribulations I have noticed one thing, we are all a lot a alike, and most of the time share a more relatable story then anyone in my inner circle. In todays technology the human interaction is becoming less and less human and more and more digitized. Screen watching instead of people watching, direct messaging instead of a hand written letter are methods of detachment driving a wedge between our true selves and the human being sitting across from us.\\n\\nSo how do I make a change in my own life toward fighting this black hole of being digitally programmed, force fed fear, and made too wallow in my insecurities. Get out there and meet people of walks of life and commit an hour of my time each day to an individual who could use a human interaction. \\n\\nA little about me!      \\nMy name is Aaron Bistrin I am a 28 year old guy from Santa Cruz California, a beautiful place to grow up.

We were sisters literally thought we would be friends forever. We graduated I got into my first relationship and we drifted apart and she never really let me know how she felt. She told me one day she wishes I would stop talking about him so much and that kind of was like ok cool that kind of sucks but not a big deal. Being in my first relationship that Iâ\\x80\\x99m currently still in it sucked not being able to talk about it because I was so excited. Anyways months passed and we got into an argument and basically we ended our friendship because she thought I was an awful friend because I was too busy for her. Fast forward a year after that we started talking again (I reached out, I always do) we started being â\\x80\\x9cfriendsâ\\x80\\x9d again but it felt so awkward. Honestly though sheâ\\x80\\x99s the only one who was ever angry and made things not feel the same. On her 21st birthday she invited everyone to her party at her house but me and told me it was because we didnâ\\x80\\x99t talk much and she didnâ\\x80\\x99t want awkward vibes at her house. After that I just unfollowed her on social media and we didnâ\\x80\\x99t talk at all. I messaged her over the summer congratulating her to see she was taking a trip to China and then she messaged me on my birthday. This all happened in 2017 so our friendship has been fucked up for like 2 years now. Because I deleted her number a while ago I decided to reach out and talk to her on Instagram saying happy birthday and hope she was doing well and she never replied and I know she saw it. So our friendship is dead. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve known itâ\\x80\\x99s been dead too for like 2 years now but how do I stop being so damn hurt? I think it hurts even more because she truly doesnâ\\x80\\x99t give a fuck and she was my best friend ever. I wish I could go back and do something else to fix it. Idk lately Iâ\\x80\\x99ve cried so much. I havenâ\\x80\\x99t been able to find a good friend like her again even though she wasnâ\\x80\\x99t THAT great. How can I stop obsessing over our friendship and just let it go? I constantly look at her Instagram to see how sheâ\\x80\\x99s doing and it just really sucks. :( ', 'How To Befriend Someone I Had An Awkward Past With?\\nI had this female friend that I met almost two years ago. Both of us were really nice with each other and we were pretty good friends at first, but my introverted mind did not help with that. After a while I started to have feelings for her and I started bringing up topics that did not concern her and was too awkward. I used to always text her almost every single day of every single hour to the point that she told my friend that I was annoying her (I knew that a couple of months later). I knew that something was up and that I made her upset but I never really knew what it was. I tried many different approaches to become her friend again but it all lead back to her thinking that I want to date her (she is not the type of person who would want to date at this age). After a year or so is when I figured out that I made her uncomfortable and gave her the notion that I wanted to talk to her only to date her and nothing else. I had an idea to confront her and apologize to her and tell her the truth of what I wanted from her but I keep having panic attacks and anxiety every time I think about doing it. What do you guys think I should do? Some might say that I should leave it behind, but I did such a horrible thing to such a great person and in all my life I have never met someone so true, genuine and wholesome in my life so I cannot give her up and make her feel this way about me. Would appreciate hearing from you people by assisting me. Thanks a bunch! :) &lt;3', \"Trying to help family of friend who committed suicide, any ideas?\\nMy friend took his life almost a year ago and his family (wife and three daughters aged 10, 14 and 18) is still reeling. None of them are getting the emotional support they need. His wife doesn't regularly see her therapist, she stays out all night several times a week with her new boyfriend, the 18 year old has suicidal thoughts, the 14 year old just feels hated by mom and, along with the 10 year old, is not getting therapy. The 18 year old is getting therapy but she's hardcore into her new religious affiliation, hating mom and can't wait to leave for college \\n\\nI've talked to the wife several times and shared my thoughts about what's going on, she's receptive when I when I speak to her, but it's apparent after this amount of time that she has no real intention of going through with getting the kids counseling and getting into family therapy, staying home more, spending more time with the kids, less time with the husband, etc.\\n\\nDoes anyone have any idea how I can help? If I keep telling her what she's not doing well, I'm afraid she's going to shut me out and then I won't be able to do anything.  \\n\\nIf this isn't a good sub for this kind of thing and you have an idea what might be, please let me know. \\n\\nEdit--I live in NYC, they are outside of Dallas, TX, so seeing them isn't much of an option.

I\\'d been best friends with her daughter since we were in 1st grade and I was over their house all the time. But for some reason when I was 14, she started asking. And she very low key but repeatedly accused me of smoking for about 2 more years. I had always been a straight A kid, top of my class, and a \"good\" kid. I had tried one cigarette when I was 13, had HATED it, and never tried another. I wasn\\'t around anyone who smoked, no friends, no peers, no family members (immediate or extended) smoked, so there\\'s no chance I smelled like smoke. But friend\\'s mom persisted, and told me that she thought that I smoked because she found cigarette butts at the end of their driveway. Because obviously that couldn\\'t have been from anyone else right?\\n\\nNow in hindsight, her behavior was absolutely bizarre. As a teen, I accepted it as, she\\'s an adult, and while I questioned her and vigorously fought back whenever she\\'d say something, it never occurred to me to get a sane adult involved. I\\'m hoping to install in my kid that they should tell me stuff like that if it ever happens. While nothing truly bad happened in my case, the lady was off her rocker, and I\\'m lucky nothing else happened.\\n\\nHow did people with older kids do that? Like I know my parents gave me the \"if people are making you uncomfortable, talk to us\" speech but this never made me upset, I just got angry and baffled at first, but then it kind of became this joke among all our friends and we just laughed at her. In hindsight, this could have ended very poorly for me had the mom escalated. ', 'Fear of leaving\\nTl;dr; Sob story.

She moved overseas around 5 years ago. She used to be such a fun, bubbly and funny person until she met her boyfriend around 3 years ago. Looking back, I can see that she was a always bit crazy and insecure (her father is emotionally abusive and tells her sheâ\\x80\\x99s worthless and stupid), but meeting him seems to have exacerbated all her bad qualities. She has a really low self esteem and perception issues when it comes to relationships. She also has OCD.\\n\\nShe was, and still is OBSESSED with her now ex boyfriend. They had an on off relationship where she thought it was normal to call him â\\x80\\x9cjust ten timesâ\\x80\\x9d in one day, and would get upset and not be able  â\\x80\\x9csleep or eatâ\\x80\\x9d if he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t reply, thinks talking on the phone three times a day is not much, they pushed and shoved each other, she hit him, he talked to other girls and acted like she wasnâ\\x80\\x99t his girlfriend, sheâ\\x80\\x99d call his voicemail just to hear his voice, he threatened to hurt her, she considered going to a shitty college just to be near him, etc.. basically an abusive and obsessive relationship with awful communication.\\n\\nEvery time she messages me, sheâ\\x80\\x99ll ask how I am and ask a few questions, and then steer the conversation back to her numerous problems and her ex. About how sheâ\\x80\\x99s so poor (goes out every second night and goes on shopping sprees), how sheâ\\x80\\x99s really sad (but wonâ\\x80\\x99t see a counselor because sheâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9ctoo poorâ\\x80\\x9d), how she wants to be confident and independent (goes back to the ex repeatedly and doesnâ\\x80\\x99t listen to any of the advice I give her), tells me she canâ\\x80\\x99t eat or sleep because sheâ\\x80\\x99s heartbroken (I told her I was eventually okay after I broke up with an ex, but she brushed it off as I hadnâ\\x80\\x99t gone out with him for as long and how she gave everything to her ex). She also says how Iâ\\x80\\x99m so lucky to live with my boyfriend and how I have such an amazing life, as if sheâ\\x80\\x99s the only person in the world that has problems.\\n\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ve talked to her multiple times about how talking about her ex all the time and her problems is effecting me (as well as her other friends), and how she should really see a professional as this behavior is really hurting her. She always apologizes and says that she didnâ\\x80\\x99t realize how it might make me annoyed, and sheâ\\x80\\x99ll send me an inspirational video or inspirational words, and asking about me before going back to changing the topic so she can talk about herself, her ex and how itâ\\x80\\x99s so hard for her right now, how she feels suffocated and her heart is broken. I understand that people go through hard times in their lives, but this has lasted at least 3 years. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve always said how Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be there for her and that if she needs to talk to someone, Iâ\\x80\\x99ll listen, but Iâ\\x80\\x99m starting to feel that this is a one way relationship.\\n\\nThe frustrating thing is that she says she agrees to everything I say, and howâ\\x80\\x99s shes going to change, but nothing has changed! She says sheâ\\x80\\x99s more confident and doing this and that to help herself, but she just plasters selfies and videos of herself going out with people to try and convince people that sheâ\\x80\\x99s having an amazing time. \\n\\nI donâ\\x80\\x99t want to just ignore her, but I donâ\\x80\\x99t think talking to her again will do anything. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been nice, brutally honest, and even angry at her and nothing has changed. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s stuck in her own tragic world and Iâ\\x80\\x99m realizing that maybe she thrives in this drama, and that sheâ\\x80\\x99s lonely and needs a boyfriendâ\\x80\\x99s attention to validate her self worth . Our other mutual friend has cut ties with her due to this. I think I have put up with this for so long as weâ\\x80\\x99re not living in the same country.. \\n\\nSorry about the long rant and formatting, Iâ\\x80\\x99m on my cellphone.\\n\\nTL;DR friend who lives overseas is emotionally draining me every time I talk to her. I have already talked to her about it multiple times, but she always goes back to her old ways.', 'Is she toxic or am I reading too much into it...rant warning\\nSo to nutshell my relationship with her is that we met at our last job and hang out a lot. It\\'s still a fairly new friendship but I\\'m noticing some things that are starting to get to me. I\\'m unemployed now and she has a awesome new job.\\n\\nSo first thing I noticed was she didn\\'t used to be the one to call me   but then when she needs a ride somewhere then she wants to chat and will try to segway the ride request in. If she made a habit out of calling any other time then I wouldn\\'t stress it. It just makes me feel used when \"I just want to check on you\" turns to \"I need a ride\". \\n\\nWhich brings me to the other issue. When she does call me it\\'s the most disrespectful phone etiquette I have ever seen. After she knows she is going to get a ride she stays on the call(must be out of guilt or not wanting to make it seem like it\\'s the only thing she wants.) but while she\\'s on the phone she does not pay attention to me. Like she\\'ll make active listening sounds that don\\'t match up, like uh huh and a giggle when I just told her that I might need to give my cats up. Without telling me or warning or any sort of hint she\\'ll just start talking to someone else around her like I\\'m not even on the other end. Worst yet almost always these calls are while she is at work and is just bored. On my end I\\'m distraction free and at the most filling out a job applications or pacing and I dunno I feel like if you are going to call your friend you should acknowledge they are on the other line and not just background noise while you browse the internet. \\n\\nWhich brings me to her job. Her job to me is the most ideal job I could think of and I already know that but she brags about to the point that I\\'m getting really bitter. She keeps telling me about how many hours she\\'s getting and during one of those phone calls even worked out how much she was expecting to make on her next check(unprompted). And she\\'s so excited about 3 week paid vacation she is getting, and her health benefits and tuition reimbursement so she\\'s going to take some classes on company dime. I mean I expressed how happy I was for her but she brings it up enough that I just wonder if she likes hurting me. \\n\\nThen there is her and her boyfriend. There is a whole thing about her and her psycho ex who even though made her feel afraid for her life, she still loves and talks to. WHILE WITH HER BOYFRIEND. I don\\'t think she cheats on her boyfriend but I don\\'t understand that whole deal that seems like an issue for another reddit thread all together. But yeh she does brag about how much sex she has with her boyfriend and how much they love each other. Which brings me to this next issue that I couldn\\'t even wrap my head around.\\n\\nSo I brought her home from work the other night and we were hanging out at my apartment. At some point she realizes that she forgot her keys back at work. This was after her work closed for the day. So I don\\'t see the big deal I offer up \"well when your boyfriend picks you up then he can let you in.\" But she doesn\\'t seem to be hooking to that and is like \"I\\'m going to check the bus scheduled and just because I\\'m curious I\\'ll check uber prices.\" I\\'m really confused at this point. \\n\\nEssentially, her plan was to just go to her boyfriends work and hang out there till he finishes closing. Keep in mind we are neighbors, he doesn\\'t have to go out of his way more than one street over and he has picked her up from my place before. Now he works about 30mins away so it would be a hell of a trek to drop her off there and make way back while it\\'s dark and rainy and I don\\'t know the area at all. At some point the brother of her boyfriend calls and says they can go hangout while she\\'s locked out and she doesn\\'t even ask me if I want to join or anything just leaves as if she had just been waiting at the busstop that whole time. \\n\\nShe reassures me that she does like hanging out and I think we do have fun when she is hanging out. So I really don\\'t want to cut her out of my life as I tend to do. It\\'s just tonight seemed to be the worst.\\n\\nSo she calls me up and tells me that her boyfriend is off of work so she won\\'t need a ride and she thought that we could all hangout. Since we were going to meet up with some more friends.\\n\\nWelp, the other friends canceled and it was just us 3. We had some dinner and then her boyfriend suggested we go see a movie. I was already dressed and ready so why the hell not. I\\'m pretty sure she agreed(it\\'s honestly hard to tell sometimes with her.) We got there and the movie me and her boyfriend were wanting to see was already playing. And she was being indecisive but eventually agreed to go. So me and him are hurrying to get to our seats while she just takes her time shuffling along. We already missed the first 15minutes. We had just had dinner but she wanted to stop at the concession and she just didn\\'t seem interested at all about being there.\\n\\nSo we watch the movie and about midway she leaves, I assume to go to the bathroom but shes gone for about 15minutes and I\\'m just sitting there thinking \"she wants us or one of us to go check on her\" but I wanted to watch the movie and I didn\\'t feel like putting up with her drama. \\n\\nAfterwards she passive aggressively sits at her seat through the entire credits. Which didn\\'t have mid credit or end credit footage. So I ask her whats wrong, and she\\'s like I just felt a wave of depression and just wanted to go home and didn\\'t know why I was even here or watching this movie and I felt forced into the whole thing. WHICH CAME OUT OF NOWHERE. If any one was forced it was me, she called me for that night out and I feel she is trying to make herself out to be a victim in it. \\n\\nI don\\'t want to end this with her, because I like her and her friends which I only know through her so it would mean cutting all of them out. It\\'s just I keep seeing how selfish she can be. I don\\'t know if this friendship can be saved or worth saving. ', \"Asian parents, jealousy, what to do?\\nHello I am an asian american son trying to help out my family. My family from Vietnam moved here 5 months ago and have been living together with my Mom and Dad. I no longer live at home, and couldn't live at home if I wanted to because of the space and my relatives here for the first time to America, which is fine with me. I recently found out about drama going on at home, it involves my mom and dad and my female cousin.\\n\\n\\nAbout one ago before my relatives moved here from vietnam, something had happen to my great aunt , she had given advice to my mom about being careful about her husband and any woman in the house. What had happen to my great aunt was, she caught her husband trying to cheat with her niece. I'm not sure if they actually had an affair or whatnot, but just warning her to be careful about this type of situation in the house. I really feel like it was unfair for my great aunt to put these thoughts in my mom's head because why do that? Especially when they are about to come and move in and start a new life in America.\\n\\n\\nSo back to the drama, my dad has been super stress out calling me, telling me that he is unable to handle the situation anymore. He said my mom thinks he is looking at my female cousin in a inappropriate way. She happens to be 19 years old. My dad just thinks this is crazy, he works 2 jobs (15 hours a day) trying to pay mortgage and pay all the bills. My mom doesn't work and stays home. My dad has been calling me saying he only is able to sleep 4 hours a night because every time he comes home from work, my mom is always giving him a ear full, and hes to the point where he can't take it anymore and thinking about just continuing to pay the bills and living somewhere else. I tried to talk to my mom and want to be completely open minded about the situation, she just tells me that I dont know, and she can tell the way he acts at home. Her reasoning is, she just can tell by the way he looks at her. She said she knows that he won't ever take it that far by cheating, but its her being jealous which is causing all this drama. \\n\\nIn the house consist of my female cousin, male cousin, aunt and uncle. Also my other aunt and uncle and my mom and dad. its a pretty full house, and my parents have been arguing every other night. My aunt called me tonight trying to keep the peace in the house and calm down both sides. My female cousin and her family has no idea this is going on. But most likely suspect something because of the arguing between my parents and im afraid they will find out whats going on soon enough, which will be really embarrassing. I feel like my mom and dad need marriage counseling, or my mom needs to see a therapist, but being asian they don't believe in these types of counseling classes and will be very hard to get my mom to agree to do something like this.  \\n\\n  ---   \\n  **tl;dr**: What can I do to help out my family? I'm not trying to take sides but I really don't think my dad would ever cheat on my mom. Every time I try to talk some sense Into my mom, she always ends up getting mad, and saying everyone thinks I'm crazy but I'm not. They have been married for 30 years and my dad has always worked two jobs his entire life to make sure all the bills are paid, that we have food and shelter.\", \"Friend leads much better life, I feel resentful\\nWe both just graduated, she had so many job offers,  I had none save for an internship.

And because she makes so much more than I do, she's always trying to get me to travel, which I can't afford since I'm saving up for grad school.  She's also currently in a relationship, and has tried to set me up with people but it never works. \\n\\nShe's a great friend but she makes me feel so inadequate. I'm begining to become resentful and envious, and I don't want to be a toxic person to be around. It's getting hard for me to hear about her achievements while I have nothing to compare, how shitty of a person would I be if I distanced myself from her for my own mental well-being? \", \"Should I support my bestfriends toxic relationship?\\nMy bestfriend has been dating a guy for the last 7 years, since they were in high school. She has grown into a gorgeous, and successful woman, while he is still acting like he is 17. She has been in therapy because of trust issues with her boyfriend for 5 years. She continually tells me all the terrible things he does, and how he lies non stop. I obviously want her to feel like she can talk to me about the relationship, but I am getting tired of watching her go through the same thing over and over again, and then the next day they make up. They see each other once a week, (or less). He cant afford a cell phone or a car, he drinks a lot, and he's just a loser in my eyes. He is lazy and waste his money on alcohol and smokes.  She could throw a rock and find a better boyfriend but she's so invested in this relationship its disgusting. She wants to marry this guy eventually, and her excuse is that he just needs to grow up a bit. HES 26! She literally gives him chance after chance, and he continues to screw up, but she is so set on being in the relationship. I know she is more then likely scared of being alone, but after 5 years of him screwing up, you think being alone would be better then being in this one sided relationship. I have no idea what to do, I am scared if I tell her that I don't want to hear anymore about this guy, then ill be a bad friend, but I also cant stand by while this guy continues to treat her like shit, and she continues to take it. What would you do? Would you be honest? Or would you stick by your friend and continue biting your tongue?\\n\", \"I can't forgive her, no matter how hard I try\\nI'm focusing on improving myself and working through repressed emotions from a difficult upbringing, namely with my grandmother. I am currently staying with her but thankfully I am already making plans and taking steps to move out within the next 5 months or so. I have stayed on and off the last several years and before I became an adult, I lived with her from birth.\\n\\nWe have a complicated relationship. Although I appreciate the things she has done for me - and she often tries to make me happy by buying me something or getting me food I like, etc. - I can't seem to let go of the deep seated anger and resentment I feel toward her for the mistakes she has made and how she has also been cruel to me.\\n\\nI understand no one is perfect; adults aren't always ideal role models to kids. But my grandmother had a unique way of mentally and emotionally hurting me as a child. She would often act like I was her partner in crime [in the absence of a husband] and made me feel responsible for her happiness. She would try to talk bad about my mom so I wouldn't favor her [my mom wasn't living with us and had mental issues]. She would give me the cold shoulder, or say things to incite anxiety and guilt in me if I happened to act like I wanted to spend more time with my mom or got in a bad mood. \\n\\nIt confuses me because I think deep in my heart I DO want a happy relationship with her...or maybe I try so hard out of guilt, knowing she has tried to make it up to me, I guess? But every so often I implode and I tell her how much she bothers me or even that I hate her. Sometimes even hearing the sound of her voice is enough to make me want to scream in irritation. I feel terrible about it and like I'm a monster. I always feel guilty when she tells me 'you're the only one who is really special to me, you're the only one I have.' [She doesn't have a close relationship with mom, her other D, or siblings.] Maybe I get angry because to me, this doesn't feel normal, it feels like I'm being trapped. \\n\\nI'm seeing a DBT therapist but we aren't making progress about this ... yet. I just wish this was not my life. I'm not looking for solutions per say, just sympathy or someone who also understands. It's so exhausting. \", 'Estranged mum possibly dying\\nHi so I\\'m basically in need of some help here with a big issue from people who have possibly experienced something similar.\\nSo it\\'s a long story and I\\'ll try and keep it to the parts the are mine to tell to keep things less complicated. So first things first me and my mother have had a somewhat rocky relationship from since I can remember, it was more of a rollercoaster and have been estranged for a year. Although the intense emotional disrupt from the relationship has lasted much longer. \\nA brief history of this would be as follows, since a young age my mum has never been the \"settle down type\" she was always away either to holidays guys she would meet online would take her on too out every weekend. Me and my sister had to learn fast from a young age that we weren\\'t able to live a childhood like most of our friends and basically raise our little brother. Sometimes she would be caught leaving us alone for so long and we\\'d have to stay with her friends so she wouldn\\'t get in trouble and others we\\'d have to just make sure not to miss school so she wouldn\\'t get caught. After years of this repeated behaviour some days easier some harder living from feast (when mum would bag herself a wealthy guy) too mum didn\\'t win at bingo this week and a 40 fag a day habit is expensive habit to keep up why don\\'t you just have beans on toast tonight, ofcourse I know that this is better than alot of kids we had a roof over our head and food in our stomachs it was always just chaos. Cut forward to my mum deciding she wanted to move back to ireland.\\nI was about 10 at the time and and as such didn\\'t want to move that\\'s when the abuse went from none of my boyfriend\\'s stay because of my kids too physical, she had us all so scared saying that while we were staying with grandad and granny and they heard us complaining this is what we\\'d get she kick us or grab us, I had been beaten before by my dad before he left so this was nothing I couldn\\'t handle and until now never really tried to think about since. I just remember that I stayed very quiet for those coming weeks.\\nWhen we moved to Ireland it was just after the first week a man showed up at my grandparents came in kissed my mum and said hello to me and my sister and said he was so glad to meet us. Turned out he was engaged to mum.....and they were planing on being married within the year, all of a sudden the reason for moving became clear. So After the breakdown of their relationship the next week the man moved back to America in the night and that was that here we were living with my grandparents in Ireland with no where else to go, my mum a big believer of why would I have to work I have kids stuck. Now I know from mum\\'s point of view this must of been a heart breaking moment, but looking back I think this is where alot of my sadness in life begins and I hate her for it. I know hate is a horrible thing to hold onto but it\\'s the only thing that got me where I am today and kept me as a person and I\\'m definitely aware I\\'m no Ghandi so judge me all you want but wait until I\\'m finished atleast.\\n\\nThe next few months were basically limbo, we moved too late to start the term at school so had to wait until the end of term and summer to join, that\\'s from April till September if I\\'m remembering right of living in the middle of nowhere in Ireland, sleeping in a room with your young brother older sister nothing to do but wait for the day to end we would take walks here or there and get to go to mass on a Saturday night but minus that it\\'s all we had I realised then that mum had failed to do the one thing that kept giving me hope that one day we could have a \"normal\" family she was nowhere to be found off on holidays for weeks one after the other while our grandparents fed us and kept us in their home. I remember a week going by without hearing anything from her and I had to assume that\\'s it she\\'s gone.\\n\\nYet she came back this time more shiny and brand new then ever, she said she had found us a house not to far away and go to school and it was the start of our new life. So ofcourse I felt overwhelmed at how amazing this might actually be. Mum made sure though to show her appreciation that Christmas by starting a huge family row with my her brothers and my grandparents, they had all chipped in to buy me and my siblings bigger toys for Christmas, I got a playstation 2 my sister got clothes and makeup and a bike my brother got lego ect that kind of thing, now Christmas was never a thing for us mum had explained from a young age that the santa thing was a lie and we would get what she could afford again this is not as bad as it sounds I\\'d rather the truth always and she at the end of the day was a single mother why would we expect anything \"big\" so ofcourse she didn\\'t like the gesture and disowned everyone there etc\\nBut we were moving to new house and starting a new life what more could I have wanted. So after living in the new house for a week mum decided that now my sister was 14 she could come on a \"girls\" holiday with her and as such they went the next week I think my sister was just happy to be out of school so went plus I didn\\'t mind my brother was older and didn\\'t need as much attention any more so I kinda looked forward to it, after they came back my sister let me know that she had done it again and gotten engaged and tried to warn me I guess that atleast I could know beforehand this time, the guy she was engaged to worked abroad the entire time so mum basically worshipped the computer so she could talk to him all the time she would sleep the same time as him (during the day) and be up all night, if ever the internet would go down or the house wasn\\'t cleaned or dinners weren\\'t in the house she would freak sometimes more physical then not, up until the day she said we were moving again so long story short the guy moved over they were engaged I was still never told by my mother and I had to sit through the guy explaining how he was gonna be my new dad for 4 hours while we drove to our new home, setting the scene it was a country bungalow which hadn\\'t been lived in for years but me and my sister had done stuff like this in the past so we started into doing it up mum didn\\'t like the physical side of it but loved the planning so she kept busy for a while, quick side note, I loved school, hated the abuse for being the English guy in an Irish school, I had ended up in hospital etc due to some of the abuse, we lived quite happily for a while until my \"new dad\" went back abroad to work for the summer, I started work that summer and so did my sister, my mum would be obcessed with my step dad when he was working who he saw etc until she decided he was definitely cheating (he wasnt) and decided she would too, she spent ages trying to get me and my sister to set up dating profiles for her and to cover on the phone if ever she was out on dates, when he returned as you could imagine arguments between them started and one thing my mother is good at is arguing she was always able to make him think he had done something wrong and she did nothing it didn\\'t help that mum would threaten to throw us out if we ever told him what happened. So that was us for a while weeks of calm and weeks of arguing. Mum must have decided to quit the online dating world for a while and started into online poker, she would find out how much we would earn and take that as rent and spend it on online poker, she would take out debts, spend it on online poker, take my stepdads wages, spend it on online poker, this isn\\'t a film so I won\\'t say she was ever good or ever won, or more anything she did win didn\\'t go straight back in. That summer we went with my step dad to his job abroad the company only could afford a one bed flat for the five of us and to keep stuff private I won\\'t say place names but it was a tropical island, 5 people, one bedroom, one bathroom and since there was a casino down the road thanks to mum no money. That\\'s when I realised that no matter how seemingly redicoulous the situation we were just furniture in mum\\'s whirlwind lifestyle. One instance I\\'ll go into detail would be this one from that summer. I had saved  Â£300 pound in secret we didn\\'t have enough money for clean water or food for the next 4 days so I thought you know what I\\'ll just say that I had a little bit of money I didn\\'t realise I had and buy food etc. So I did, mum seen the food swore and gave off loads had me return it and took the money to the casino.....that is one instance of many. \\nSo after that summer mum went back to her online poker and we went back to normal until the next summer when mum decided she wanted to go to America with a friend from online, no prize for guessing what kind of friend, and that\\'s the summer when I kind of shut down, I stopped eating and I stopped caring, I finally thought maybe if I very quietly and very slowly wasted away it would all be ok I didn\\'t need to be around. I would cook everyone else\\'s Meals and just say I had something to eat while cooking, I lost 4 stone in 2 months. Even as im typing this its hard to write. I talked to my mother once in those two months, the time she had no money and needed help. I went into auto pilot I would wake up clean the house play playstation with my brother make dinner and stay up till 3 in the morning with background noise sometimes I cut myself sometimes I would exercise till I vomited, I was slowly dying and that goal was what got me through the day that one day hopefully I wouldn\\'t wake up, my sister was too busy with her new boyfriend and I didnt want to ruin her happiness my brother was too young to understand I thought and my step dad just wanted a clean house and for what he was wearing to work and eating at work to be sorted. \\n\\nSo then the message came that mum wanted us to come to America and stay with her for a bit. Once there at the airport was the first time I\\'d seen my mum cry. The first time shed shown genuine concern for me, in fairness being \"big boned\" in our family was normal we are tall and none of us underweight, and there I stood 16 years old 6ft1 and a total of 8 stone must of been mad for her I guess.\\nSo if you guessed it right remember no prizes she was in America with another man he like all of mum\\'s affairs seemed nice but not really in it for the kids they would have their relationship and we would be in the background. A million times o wanted to tell the poor guy but being stranded in a different continent didn\\'t seem like something that we could get out off so I kept quiet. Things went on as they would mum would act like she was single and we\\'d have to agree with whatever lie she told. Her visa ran out and we had to go back home.\\nThese times seem like they should involve more but at this point I was too numb to the world I didn\\'t register it I would live in the lie I had to and disconnect.\\n\\nMum and my stepdads relationship continued to take on more strain every time with more and more intensity. Mum did try a little more to be a mother to me and even took me to doctors apointments to help try and deal with my depression and ofcourse I don\\'t blame her for it I had decided what I wanted to do and I am responsible for that. Our relationship improved a little and I actually gained some nice memories. \\n\\nSo in the next year something well something really bad happened to me, I don\\'t like going into too many details but the overall was I taken advantage of by someone I thought I could trust and to this day I still struggle with calling it rape but deep down I know that it was, my sexuality had never been a big deal to me as id always known and never acted on it but I told someone for the first time and well yeah non consenting acts occurred.\\n\\nThe reason why I\\'m saying this is because Its what lead me to try to come out to my mother, our relationship was at its best and so I felt I needed to tell someone what had happened to me and at the very least try and get some help because I was already mental as fragile as I was.\\n\\nThe long and short is it didn\\'t turn out well, I mean imagine your worst situation and how low you felt. Now sink a little lower.\\n\\nI tried to tell my friends and get help and if not for one person I don\\'t think I would have made it through.\\n\\nI still had to finish school though and with only a year left I lived through that situation and my past experiences taught me how to become numb.\\n\\nCut to me getting the results I needed and getting into the course I wanted. \\n\\nI moved out after much arguing and for the first time I was free to be the person I knew I could be, I made so many new friends i gained weight for the first time I was always independent and knew I was happy. Like actually happy.\\n\\nI met a guy the most thoughtful caring person and still to this day I think I\\'m glad I didn\\'t die because every day is worth whatever he\\'ll I went through\\n\\nStuff with mum was still messy but it was away and in it\\'s neat little box of past baggage. She would ring and talk about a new guy she met and then talk about how much she loves my step dad.\\n\\nI finally thought you know what last chance I\\'m going to tell her about the guy in my life and if she didn\\'t like it then I could move on and understand that maybe she wasn\\'t supposed to understand and leave it at that but to my suprise she seemed fine with it.\\n\\nWeeks past he met my family and my mum was lovely it was weird like she was a different person out relationship became so much better she still borrowed money shed never give back and cheated but we could talk about other things normal things.\\n\\nThings continued with their ups and downs for a few years I carried on being happy and asked the guy to marry me which he said yes too. That\\'s when the bigger troubles started.\\n\\nSo a quick list.\\nMum wouldn\\'t allow him to keep the engagement ring on.\\nShe demanded monthly visits regardless of what was happening\\nStarted alienating his family and comparing their lives and how different they were to us\\nPitting my brother and sister against me and themselves\\n\\nAnd just general, idk mental abuse without sounding too intense it was weird because anytime it would get seriously intense and be basically ruining any day to day stability she would stop and be nice again for a few weeks. \\n\\nIt was unfair to my fiance though alot of the time it felt as if she kept making situations in which he would have to increasingly prove him self with the more he would do. Sometimes it came down to outright having to prove his love to me and became more and more frequent. She started to try and control our wedding ie spending, decor etc. \\n\\nThe event that started the end was when we had to unfortunately rehome our cat due to him not getting along with our dog etc this sent mum berserk she rang my work demanding to speak to me and completely dressed me down on the phone and my fiance and how dare we calling me and my fiance worse than our father\\'s  (both of which had left us as kids)\\nShe said we weren\\'t to rehome it and weren\\'t allowed etc. My sister and brother got involved and were repeating my mother\\'s words. Showing the same cycle of go along with mum or terrible things happen. \\n\\nSo then there was an issue with Christmas this is a long one so to keep it short basically how dare I suggest to go to my fiances family even though he had been to ours and how as my mother I am not allowed at this point I\\'m 23 years old.\\n\\nStraw that broke the camel\\'s back, mum\\'s dog unfortunately died, and with work I wasn\\'t able to make it down and neither was my fiance, we were barred from the \"open house\" they decided to do for the dog and we received phone calls daily calling us all the names under the sun. My fiance had recently got a job with the nhs and was starting it on the Monday and as such said on Facebook he was happy to about this. Now I got a phone call from my mother but it wasn\\'t a sane person it was unbelievable and to this day still scares me, from moments maniacal laughter to screaming to whispering she did it all at how dare he be happy on the day her dog was being cremated......it was some scary stuff like I am a huge animal lover yes but the way she felt personally attack that someone had something good in their life when she didnt that day was disturbing. That night my sister calls and is basically the same except for the line \"if you can\\'t attend dog funerals then we can\\'t attend weddings\" and that was it. That was the moment. \\n\\nI hung up the phone saying I wish them happiness and health and that if this is the way it is then that\\'s it.\\n\\nAnd that was it I blocked them from contacting me and had one of the best years of my life.\\n\\nI have become mentally stronger, I am happier and I\\'m well I feel like the person I\\'m supposed to be.\\n\\nUntil today I get a message from an account on Instagram \"mum has cancer can you give me a number to contact you on\"\\n\\nNow in all this I haven\\'t even mentioned everything like the fact mum has pretended to have a heart attack before and has lied about equally as worse.\\n\\nI know it\\'s a horrible thing to not want to reach out after a message like that but I don\\'t want to go back to the pain I was in before I feel like can\\'t breathe when I even think about giving my number and know that even if it\\'s true and she does have cancer that I could never have a relationship that isn\\'t toxic with these people I need advice and help but mostly I needed to share so thanks if ya read this far there\\'s so much to this and I feel like I haven\\'t even mentioned half the stuff that happened but please do I stick to social norms and try and be a good son or do I put my mental health first.\\n\\nThanks', '19 M here...family dispute between uncle\\'s n dad.

We were our first best friends. We ended up going to different schools throughout high school and college, but we never drifted too far. \\nYesterday, she turned 21. She was coming into town to go to a local bar, but Iâ\\x80\\x99m not of age yet. She told me I could come, but I figured she was just going to be there with her boyfriend and other friends who are 21. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t want to sit there drinking a Sprite while they all got drunk, so I let her enjoy her evening. I figured she would celebrate later again anyway (which she is.) \\nToday, she posts on her Snapchat story her and all our mutual friends (underage friends) drinking and having fun over in one of our friends apartments. I was not invited. I got her a gift and was ready to celebrate with her.

She hangs with a select group of about 5 or 6 people who Iâ\\x80\\x99ve known longer than her. I donâ\\x80\\x99t really get invited to anything at all, only once in a blue moon. She sometimes tries to hang out with me when she comes into town from college. \\nIs it time to take a huge step back from this friendship?

What should I do?\\nI know it was wrong but I had a gut feeling to check her messages today when I was helping her with something on her phone. I snooped and saw that my mother has been messaging this man (I do know of him as he helped my family in a business transaction 1 year ago). \\n\\nShe has been messaging him for a few months almost every other night. It dates back to a year ago but it only started looking obsessive (every other day) from approximately 5 months ago.\\n\\nHe has not been replying her. If it's a reply, its extremely rare. It's constant double blue ticks (means he read the message) on whatsapp. What should I do? I'm not sure if my mum realises that this is a creepy act or that she's bothering him because he hasn't said a single word or that she's doing it cause she's lonely and confused.\\n\\nMy mum is 55+ and she's been divorced for 19 years now. I'm really not sure what to do or how to react to this situation as it totally caught me offguard. Please help.\", \"Close friend becoming distant....\\nSo Iâ\\x80\\x99ve (f,21) had a friend (m,21) that Iâ\\x80\\x99ve known for over two years, and we typically text or snap daily. There are times where we are texting or snapping straight for a couple of hours or we get busy with other stuff so we reply when we have a chance. Two weeks ago we had been hanging out at his place and everything to me seemed normal. Then out of the blue this week I feel as though heâ\\x80\\x99s become extremely distant. He stopped basically replying to me at all. Itâ\\x80\\x99s been a couple of days in a row that he only responds a couple of times in the morning and then is gone during the entire day. Since Iâ\\x80\\x99ve known him, he has never been this way. (I'm sure some might say he's in a relationship, but he's currently single. Plus when he was in a relationship, he didn't act this way.)\\n\\nSo last week I had sent him something early in the day and he didnâ\\x80\\x99t reply until the following day. I didnâ\\x80\\x99t think much of it because the next couple of days we were chatting like nothing and I was sure he was completely busy. Keep in mind, this was a couple days before he basically went blank on me. It actually got me thinking of what I had said that first day and think why heâ\\x80\\x99d be so mad possibly to respond. The day that it had all started I had told him I had applied to a place and had gotten a interview the following day. I told him this even though heâ\\x80\\x99s told me heâ\\x80\\x99s been applying to different places and hasnâ\\x80\\x99t gotten a single interview. When I told him I didnâ\\x80\\x99t think that it would affect him that much since heâ\\x80\\x99s told me heâ\\x80\\x99d never apply to the place Iâ\\x80\\x99m gonna start working at. (Like he straight up told me heâ\\x80\\x99d rather die than work at that place.) However, he's not the type to be petty or take things like that extremely hard and to heart.\\n\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m not sure how I should think about all of this.I have anxiety (which is why Iâ\\x80\\x99m stressing) but Iâ\\x80\\x99m telling myself he may be going through something and I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to just push him. Weâ\\x80\\x99ve gotten extremely close enough to the point where weâ\\x80\\x99ve discussed things that are vulnerable things. He's dealt with major stuff and so have I, so I also find it weird that he wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t talk to me about any of it (if it was something personal).\\n\\nShould I continue waiting basically a day for a response, or let it ride out and see if he gets back to himself and talks? Do you think heâ\\x80\\x99s trying to ghost me? Or should I ask him whatâ\\x80\\x99s happening? (And if I do what should I say so that Iâ\\x80\\x99m not exactly targeting him). He has depression and we have discussed serious matters so I don't want to make him feel bad.\\n\\nFeel free to ask any questions. Thanks!\", \"How do I befriend my crush?\\nSo there's this girl (21/f) that I (21/f) really, really like. I live in a super homophobic country. I've accepted the fact that nothing can happen between us. However, she's just such, such an amazing person, that even if we weren't romantically involved, I would want her in my life, as a friend, because she's just so great - no joke. I'm not sure what her impression of me is. My crush and I actually have a ton of mutual acquaintances and friends. We've even worked together on an event before, but it was a large scale event with a large team, so I didn't really feel much. She once even smiled at me when she saw me!\\n\\nI have a friend who once had a guy give her chocolate that he â\\x80\\x9ccouldnâ\\x80\\x99t finishâ\\x80\\x9d when we were in the library. The next day, he messaged her on Facebook, saying she probably felt weirded out by what he did â\\x80\\x93 she responded to him, and they started talking to each other. Theyâ\\x80\\x99ve now been dating for over a year. The bottom line is, with all this information in mind, how do I approach my crush to hopefully start a friendship with her? I've been warned that I should draw a mental boundary between feelings of friendship and romantic feelings, which Iâ\\x80\\x99m set on doing. I would do what my friendâ\\x80\\x99s boyfriend did, but with these chocolate chip cookies I baked, though I'm not sure if it'd be a good idea. It would seem a little weird, wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t it?\\n\\nEven with my friendâ\\x80\\x99s boyfriend, we knew his intentions from the start. My crush and I are both girls, however, so I suppose that changes things a little (we do live in a heteronormative society). With all that said, Iâ\\x80\\x99m pretty desperate, as sheâ\\x80\\x99s graduating soon, and I really donâ\\x80\\x99t want to miss my chance. She's completed all her subjects and is currently only working on her dissertation. She's often in the student lounge, doing work - though I'm not sure what her schedule is like and what days she's in campus. Please help with creative ways to approach my crush (like my friend's boyfriend did)! Thanks!\", 'A friend of mine is being mean, or am I sensitive?\\nA long time friend of mine (letâ\\x80\\x99s call her Abby) has recently been a little cruel imo, but Iâ\\x80\\x99m not sure if itâ\\x80\\x99s me. These three things happen in less than 2 days and now weâ\\x80\\x99re not speaking. Also, weâ\\x80\\x99re 14 and just started high school.\\n\\n1: She laughed at my new haircut. I know that sounds frivolous, but Abby and this other girl were literally outright laughing. She claims she was just â\\x80\\x98being honestâ\\x80\\x99.\\n\\n2: She left me wandering. We had agreed to walk to an after school event together. She started walking without me and didnâ\\x80\\x99t tell me, so I was walking around the high school, sending her a million messages trying to find her. I guessed she had left, but I didnâ\\x80\\x99t want to ditch her if she hadnâ\\x80\\x99t. I eventually just walked by myself. When I got there (late) it turned out she walked with two other girls (including the hair-laughing girl). When I called her out she said I was overreacting and that walking alone shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t bother me (it didnâ\\x80\\x99t, I was upset because she didnâ\\x80\\x99t care about me) and that she wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t care if the shoe was on the other foot. All I asked was that she apologize and next time *let me know* if she changed plans, which earned a sarcastic/sassy â\\x80\\x98weâ\\x80\\x99ll sor-ryâ\\x80\\x99.\\n\\n3: Another friend of mine and Abbyâ\\x80\\x99s (itâ\\x80\\x99s a trio friendship) asked to hang out (her name will be Robin). Abby didnâ\\x80\\x99t come which I was kind of glad about, so it was just me and Robin. We walked around town and all. It wasnâ\\x80\\x99t even very late (6:00) when this one group of guys (4 of them, 18ish) hollered at us from their car. At first we thought it was a prank, but it kept going. They did this multiple times, following us or looping back around to greet us. We were getting freaked out. So, when they loop back around again Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had enough. I yelled at them to F*** off.\\n\\nI thought this was smart. I figured theyâ\\x80\\x99d either realize we werenâ\\x80\\x99t having fun or something. Surprise, surprise, it made things worse. A lot worse.\\n\\nEventually, they got stuck at a light and we sprinted to a family members house nearby (who turned out had recently been hospitalized) and hid there until my Mom came.\\n\\nNow, I know the F off move was incredibly dumb. I made it worse not only for myself but for my friend. Either way, the next day I was feeling guilty as hell and worried about Robin and what she thought of me and was just stressed in general. Not in a good mood.\\n\\nI donâ\\x80\\x99t even tell my friend what happened, she greets me with weird hints about last night. So I simply ask her to stop with these weird hints and actually talk to me. Basically, Robin told her about last night. So Abby being super nice says, to the best of my memory, â\\x80\\x9cYou realize your mistake, right? You understand that it was your fault. So just so you know, I have no sympathy at all.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nI know I was dumb, but hearing this after everything and what I already blamed myself for being told so bluntly and harshly at me by my friend set me off. I left and actually went and cried in the girls washroom that I know no one ever uses. Iâ\\x80\\x99m not sure what I expected, it was my fault, but she *greeted* me like this. No, â\\x80\\x9cHey, I heard you were followed...â\\x80\\x9d or ANYTHING. Just straight up â\\x80\\x9citâ\\x80\\x99s your fault I have no sympathy.â\\x80\\x9d Like, Hey, nice to see you too.\\n\\nEither way, weâ\\x80\\x99re not talking anymore. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve tried to bring it up but itâ\\x80\\x99s always, â\\x80\\x9cI was just being honest... what did you expect? So you want me to lie? Youâ\\x80\\x99re being silly...â\\x80\\x9d No acknowledgement. Also, this fight between me and Abby is affecting my friendship with Robin because it was a trio friendship. Also, Abby is my only friend at my school, Iâ\\x80\\x99m scared to be alone.\\n\\nSorry for how long this is, I think itâ\\x80\\x99s sort of a rant too. What should I do? Am I completely out of line? How should I go about fixing this?\\n\\nAt the very least, how can I prevent this from affecting me and Robin?\\n\\n', 'Help...Relationship with my depressed, mentally messed up friend\\nThis is my first time posting on reddit, sorry if I have made any mistakes.\\n\\nThis post is gonna be quite long. To start with, my friend and I are both 15 year olds living in Hong Kong and we study in the same school. She is a great person, very special, someone I can never forget. The problem is that she is the kind of person who smiles in front of people but is actually depressed. And I feel like I will just make things worse.\\n\\nBecause of her laughs and near-crazy actions, nobody knows her true feelings. In fact she constantly complains about everything, being unpopular, being immature, the education system here, her online friends, just to mention a few. She is tired and feels like a loser all the time. Games and cosplaying is the only way she escapes from reality. I don\\'t mind listening to rants. It\\'s ok to be sad. But I seriously do not know how to respond when she comes up with questions related to suicide.\\n\\nDuring lessons my friend would show me long paragraphs about her self hate and ask for my reply. A typical example of our conversation: \"Why am I so unpopular?\" \"...\" \"WHY AM I SO UNPOPULAR.\" \"...maybe you have different hobbies and interests from most people?\" Then she starts to regret her choices, why did she choose to study in this school, if she had been in another school, she would have been happier... etc.\\n\\nIn her letters, she questioned about the meaning of life. She wrote about \"nightmares\", \"thought crimes\" and \"leaving the endless circle of life\". That left me terrified. All I could do is to sit next to her speechless. If I said something wrong she would just jump off from the roof. Not to mention all those confusing philosophical questions. I can never give an answer simply because I don\\'t know how.\\nI once asked the school social workers how to talk to a depressed friend. Her advice was literally trash, and I ended up crying when I talked about her suicidal thoughts. I have no idea what to do. The next day when you see her at the school gates, she puts on that smile again, but she definitely has problems.\\n\\nAnyone has experience in dealing with such friends? Depressed friends who smiles all the time? It sounds weird to ask what I can do for you, because she normally won\\'t respond (at least I think so). What should I (or should not) say to her?', \"Best friend of 7 years dropped me like nothing.\\nSo I'm in an LDR, and my boyfriend came to visit where I live for the first time. It was our second meeting so we were so happy to be together. So I took him to meet my best friend who had supported me in my relationship because she had a similar situation going on. After my visit with him at her house, I asked if we could go over again the next night and she told me no because I third wheeled her in her own house. However, I don't feel we did that because we weren't affectionate around her and her parents were in the room as well. A little after he left I apologize to her even though I didn't feel I had done anything wrong. Recently, she has deleted me off most social media platforms and if Imma be honest... I don't care. \\n\\nYes. I miss having the girl companion, having another girl to talk to about things. But, I don't want a friend that isn't a true friend. Who just dumps 7 years of friendship over feeling like a 3rd wheel. I think there was a jealousy element to it but I'll never know. Because I'm not chasing her, she's gotta come to me. I'm don't chasing her \", 'I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to lose friendship of 10 years but I think itâ\\x80\\x99s going that way\\nHi guys,\\n\\nI donâ\\x80\\x99t usually do this but I literally feel like I have nowhere else to vent.\\n\\nOk. I have been friends with this person for 10 years since we were teenagers. We both clicked over time through going to the same school and I really liked her personality. We ended up going to college in the same city so during that time we sometimes hung out and I let her stay over at my place a few times when she needed to. After graduation sheâ\\x80\\x99s spent some time living in other countries teaching and we have kept in contact but not as much, though we have met up when sheâ\\x80\\x99s been back.\\n\\nSo the last time I saw her in person was when she was on a break from teaching 3 months ago. Since then we have occasionally talked but itâ\\x80\\x99s been me sending messages more than her. The last time we Skyped was 2 months ago and last time we had a proper conversation was a month and a half ago when I asked her for some advice about a trip I was going on. I then stopped messaging her for a few weeks as I didnâ\\x80\\x99t want to bother her if she was busy. Started messaging again but just sending a few pictures of my trip and seeing if she wanted to talk. She saw my messages but didnâ\\x80\\x99t reply. So I left it another week - I sent her a few messages today but again she was online and reading them and no reply. I have tried not to bother her if sheâ\\x80\\x99s busy and have stressed to her that I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to bother her but she has just gone silent on me since late January and itâ\\x80\\x99s basically been me trying to initiate conversation with her and her not responding.\\n\\nThe thing is I am racking my brain and trying to think what I could have done to upset her - if anything, and I canâ\\x80\\x99t think of anything. I have questioned whether Iâ\\x80\\x99m getting ahead of myself but then not having her around makes me miss her and feel hurt that sheâ\\x80\\x99s suddenly decided to stop talking to me for whatever reason. The thing is I have been considering what loss it would be for me to not be friends with her anymore - It wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be easy for me as she is one of the only few people I still speak to from my school days and we could relate so much to each other. \\n\\nBut if for some mysterious reason sheâ\\x80\\x99s cut me off and no longer wants to be friends then what can I do? I basically sent her a message saying I wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t try contacting her again voluntarily and left it at that. I feel like I may never hear from her again and it really hurts. But what can I do? If something isnâ\\x80\\x99t there anymore then itâ\\x80\\x99s just not there.\\n\\n- A 20 something year old female who is tired of petty childish bullshit', \"Is there any chance of me being able to fix the friendship?\\nHello all,\\n\\nNeeding some advice on how to fix this friendship, or even if I should.\\n\\nSo, I met this girl at a club, and before I knew it, we became great friends. She would come round my place all the time. We would drink. Have some deep conversations on really interesting subjects. And, most importantly, laugh with each other and just hang out. Being at uni and doing the same course, she would also always try to help me when I was struggling, which was something I really appreciated.\\n\\nAnyway, sometime before Christmas, I screwed up and hurt her feelings. She didn't tell me this, and I only know because I got it out of her - through text. I've tried to apologize to her before Christmas. No real luck. I wished her Happy Christmas and New Years. She did the same to me.\\n\\nNow we're both back at Uni. It got awkward, as I was with my friends and she was with her friends, both sitting at the same table. \\n\\nAt this point, the WhatsApp conversation we had went like this:(she doesn't speak to me in person anymore or even look at me): \\n\\n...\\n\\n[13:21, 1/22/2018] Me: Hi ....\\n\\n[13:23, 1/22/2018] Her: Hi\\n\\n[13:24, 1/22/2018] Me: How you been?\\n\\n[13:25, 1/22/2018] Her: I m good\\n\\n[13:25, 1/22/2018] Her: You?\\n\\n[13:26, 1/22/2018] Me: All good.

Both students living alone.\\n\\nObesity related health issues don\\'t just run in her family - they\\'ve killed almost half her relatives. Six years ago, she ate fine, sure she was \"curvy\" but that was her build, her nature. She went on walks with her friends. Now she can barely make it to her front door. Her cousin - in his teens - died recently from heart failure. Weight related.\\n\\nYet, she continues to put on weight, eat awful food - like taking home meat double burgers from mc donalds and then re-frying them at home, for breakfast, plus sweets, every day - and also taking energy drinks all day followed by sleeping pills at night. That is, physically, killing her according to her doctors, but there\\'s where our issues as friends start.\\n\\nWhat\\'s killing out friendship is her desperation - but absolute lack of effort - when it comes to loosing weight. She talks about switching back to eating the things that, when we first met, she loved - banana breakfast smoothies and chicken schnitzel. She even did a Go Fund Me for a stomach reduction surgery. Has seen more nutritionists than I knew existed. Yet whatever happens, she only eats more, or worse. She was told to stop eating pringles, and replace them with a healthy alternative like corn wafers but instead, she swapped them for deep fried pork buns. And so on.\\n\\nFriends have always offered to help, to buddy up, to go with. I\\'ve been on diets she ditched the first day. I\\'ve been to the gym only to have her \"go bathroom\" out the front door. Everyone else gave up.\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t help that her family, Fijian-Indians, seem to see food as the only way to show love. The early years, when she actually tried to diet, they\\'d constantly bring her fatty treats because they thought she looked too skinny. And of course, she\\'d eat them. And they\\'d bring more.\\n\\nI have seen her go through almost four years of pretending she\\'ll try. I\\'ve gotten so excited and so happy and so hopeful only to have it thrown in my face. I love her, but in all honesty, I don\\'t want to keep waiting and watching for her to die. Because that\\'s what the diagnosis has been for the past 6 months - change her life, or die from complications. But all she does is whine about being fat, and then ask me to order in pizza. \\n\\nWhat would you do?  I don\\'t want to continue to watch her kill herself, but I can\\'t think of anything I can possibly do to help her change.', 'dealing with an emotionally unavailable best friend\\nI see my best friend a lot. I dont wear my heart on my sleeve but I\\'m emotional. I definitely give too much in a relationship and end up getting hurt because of it. My friend has troubles expressing her emotions and generally gets very annoyed when she has to \"prove herself\" because she feels like people should just trust her. She doesn\\'t have many friends because of this. I always express my irrational feelings but when shes angry she doesnt want to say anything because she doesnt want to hurt me. I don\\'t want her to hold anything in but I know that I would suffer because of the truth.\\n\\nHow do I balance our give and take? \\nIs there anyway I can help her open up? Or is that impossible?\\n', \"Tipped off by someone that best friend is not okay\\nIt's been a semester in college and people here are very interesting. \\nRecently, I [F] made a best friend Theo* [M] in class. We're both in the same major, speak the same native language, and he always helps me understand the homework (he's smarter than me), meaning that we spend about 2 hours/day together, if not more. We got super close within a few weeks, and I started to develop a crush on him. But I have a boyfriend (long-distance), and my feelings for Theo were not sexual, so I resolved to think of Theo as just an older brother - it hasn't been a problem for a few weeks now. We still hang out as best friends.\\n\\nMy primary means of communication with him is facebook in our native language. A week before, he added me on snapchat, but we never talk on it. The other day, I got a snap with a mispelling of my name, to which I sent a question mark. The day after, I got a snap from a girl Lucy* claiming to be Theo's boyfriend, who told me she got my username from Theo. She told me that he was acting weird, and for my name w/mispelling, to look out for him since they were also long distance. \\n\\nI don't know how to approach the situation. I want to make sure that Theo is okay, since I did have some problems with suicidal/bored/lonely friends before. But he never told me that he has a girlfriend or about Lucy, and when I took to other forms of social media to find her, I couldn't find her - she wasn't in any tagged photos of Theo either. I may be completely over thinking, but I also think that Lucy has ascess to Theo's snap, which is how she got to me - meaning that I'm not sure if Theo knows that I know Lucy. If she has ascess to the snap, she could also have acess to his facebook (although I'm pretty sure she can't speak our native language).... Basically, I'm not sure how to approach him to ask if he's okay okay. I always ask how his day was, and it ranges from okay to sleepy. So if I ask if he's okay, he might ask me why I thought he wasn't okay, and I don't think I can say his girlfriend was wondering - we don't talk about relationship stuff, I don't think he know I have a boyfriend, although this is posted all over my social media.\\nGoing down a rabbit hole - please help!\", \"relationship with sister falling apart, different memories, need advice\\nHi,\\n\\nIn a nutshell - my sister (both about 30years old) has been accusing me of saying various horrible/bad things, often saying I said it seconds ago, sometimes hours ago and getting angry with me.\\n\\nI don't think I've been saying these things.\\n\\nIt's really wearing me down, either I am being horrible and forgetting, or she is (perhaps unknowingly) making it up.\\n\\nI've recently said I'm going to record some of our conversations to see if I can prove my innocence, or find out I have an issue with my memory/attitude and get help.\\n\\nThis has gone down very badly, she now insists I don't speak to her for at least as long as I may record her.\\n\\nWhat do I do?

She keeps guilt tripping me about being away for college, and saying Iâ\\x80\\x99m on a permanent holiday. \\n\\nShe is annoyed at me for having a boyfriend; she never uses his name only refers to him as â\\x80\\x9cyour friendâ\\x80\\x9d in a sneering voice, and she wonâ\\x80\\x99t meet him. \\n\\nShe is by no means a bad person, she has always been a very good mother but the pressure she is putting on me is too much and I feel very restricted, and at times, controlled. BUT I am not giving out about her, simply want to understand why she is acting this way when Iâ\\x80\\x99ve given her no reason to distrust me and Iâ\\x80\\x99m trying my best. \\n\\nTL;DR - mother is controlling, putting huge pressure on me and is never happy no matter how well I do.', \"I am scared\\nHey guys, posting this on a throw away just incase.\\n\\nAnyway, a bit of back story:\\nMe and this guy at work met because of our smoking habits. We both happen to smoke weed, so naturally we started hanging out together. It was all cool for a while, and then he started getting needy, trying to get whatever he could from me. He would ask for cash, ask me to buy him food, ask me for bud etc.\\n\\nThen I found out by mistake that he is a meth smoker, which is something I do not agree with at all. He just became more hostile around me after this point (not physically, only slightly verbally/emotionally), so I decided to slowly break the tie.\\n\\nSo I started to ignore his messages and Facebook texts. I quit work btw (its been 6 months). He doesn't know where I live, but we both know that our town is very small. Basically everyone knows everyone here. So the chance of me meeting up with him in the future is very possible.\\n\\nAnyway, as bad as all that sounds, I want to try and mend the relationship.

Seems like she feels as if she is superior, the leader of our whole class and everyone has to follow and do what she says. If someone is late to the meetings she is harassing them. She is being very rude and insulting. Her voice is always extremely loud, and if she has a problem with people she always shouts it to the class instead of approaching the person and discussing it with them like a normal person would do.\\n\\nFor example, she was upset with a group of her classmates because they didnt want to follow whatever she says, and she heard that they might have said something bad about her, but instead of approaching them to ask them about it, if its true or whatsoever, everytime we have meetings she will just talk extra loud and will let our whole class listen to her nonsense comments like she keeps on talking about \"fake people\", as if she wanted the group who said something about her to hear it and feel guilty.\\n\\nI dont get why she does it and why she is the way she is. Does anyone have an idea? And what should we do about it? It\\'s getting annoying and I know already if we would approach and talk to her she would put the blame on everyone else and just be more mad and find stupid excuses. Does anyone have any advice? By the way, including teachers or some other people doesnt help either so any other advices or info to shed light on this is welcome.

I don\\'t know what to do\\nRecently two friends of mine (dating) have cut me off entirely without providing a reason... Let\\'s call them J and K. J is an old friend from years back, when we were kids, and K has been my friend since highschool (approx. Six years). Its happened before that they\\'ve cut me off periodically for no given reason, then their idea of making up is inviting me to a party and never speaking of the weeks or months that they had me blocked on social media, when i ask them to explain they get defensive, and say things along the lines of \"you KNOW what you did\" even when i try to explain that no, i actually don\\'t. I\\'ve never consciously done anything to hurt them, the one thing i thought it could be was that I\\'m friends with a girl they dislike, but after recently confronting J its apparently not just that, there\\'s a long list of reasons why I\\'m a terrible friend but he \"doesn\\'t have time to list them\" or even name one. Feeling insecure about this I\\'ve confided in other friends who assure me that I\\'m not a bad friend, although I\\'ve asked that they tell me if i ever act like a bitch. \\nBack to K and J, they recently went so far as to invite all 3 of my siblings along with a crowd of people they barely know to their housewarming, but made a point to exclude me- when my brother asked why the response was along the lines of I\\'m \"acting like a bitch\". I\\'ve tried just cutting them out but its hard after being friends (i think) for so many years. I\\'ve tried extending olive branches, explaining that i don\\'t know what I\\'ve done wrong and if they could at least tell me then maybe i could apologize/fix the situation, but J responded with passive aggression and K, so far, hasn\\'t responded at all. (Quite frankly i don\\'t expect her to). \\n\\nBottom line is, should i just cut them off entirely? Its hard since I\\'ll be seeing a lot of K this year as we\\'re studying the same course, and J is one of my brother\\'s best friends.

All of them are single. Well, at least one of them is somewhat single. The less-single one is Charlotte. Charlotte has a new beau, who she has been seeing on the low for about two months. Melanie and Jenny can see that Charlotte is smitten. Ok, no big deal. All is good. \"Do you, girlfriend! Just don\\'t lose yourself\". (Names have been changed)\\n\\nSo everyone is planning for the NYE party. Melanie and Jenny have their outfits ready to go. The dress that Charlotte ordered is not going to be in on time for the party, so the back-up plan is to go the mall and find a new dress. Melanie goes with her, and Charlotte, reluctantly buys the best dress she can find, but it is not nearly as fabulous as the first dress she ordered online - which, again, won\\'t arrive on time.\\n\\nThe ladies planned to all go to Melanie\\'s house early on the day of NYE to slowly get ready, play some good music, eat pizza and have a few drinks before they summon the Uber to take them to the party.\\n\\nThe night before, however, the party\\'s promoters announce on facebook that the venue has changed to another location. A little aggravating, but not a big deal. They decide they\\'re not gonna let that mess up their NYE and want to have fun anyway.\\n\\nAnyhow, on Jan 31, at 5pm-ish, Charlotte sends a group text to the other ladies:\\n\\nHey ladies, i know you\\'ll probably hate me for this, but I\\'m not gonna go.

', \"My mother and her tragically unlucky family\\nHey, guys, I thought this was worth posting because I'm still totally gobsmacked at how unlucky and dysfunctional my mother's side of the family was, and it interests me because it sounds like a curse, when it was likely all just chance.\\n\\nMy mother was born in the late 50's, and it was my grandparents' third child, although she eventually had six siblings in the end (only two brothers are still alive). The way my auntie and uncles died, and how one turned out, creeps me out. So here we go;\\n\\nSo my mother used to have younger twin siblings - one boy and one girl - and my mother when she was four got into a serious car accident (grandfather was driving) so this would be 1962. She and my grandfather survived but her twin siblings didn't survive and both were tragically killed at the age of two.\\n\\nBut it gets unluckier.\\n\\nSo, a few years go by, my mother has two new little brothers at the time (let's call them George, born in 1963, and Alan, born a couple of years later)\\n\\n1975, and again a tragic loss. My grandparents and family go through the loss of George, who, if you do the simple math, was only twelve when he died in a boat accident during a school trip. Apparently he jumped in the water to impress his friends while kayaking, and a boat later came speeding, didn't see him, and the front of it struck George's head. He drowned while unconscious because the teacher wasn't present (and apparently, he got in alot of shit for that).\\n\\nBut again, it gets unluckier.\\n\\nFour years later, 1979, my grandfather, who was one of the bosses of a distribution warehouse, got into an accident during work. Wasn't told how, but it was fatal.\\n\\nSo during the late 70's leading up to my grandfather's death, my mother's two older brothers (let's name them Johnny and Frank, both in their twenties) end up doing drugs, although my uncle Frank apparently handled his habit better than Johnny. Uncle Johnny eventually moved onto injecting heroin, was stealing off family and friends until he got kicked out of my grandma's. He eventually disappeared from the family.\\n\\nSo 1983, after a couple years from last hearing of Johnny, my mother and her family receive news that a body found overdosed in a park four months prior, belonged to Johnny. Died at twenty-seven and wasn't identified for months by forensics. He was homeless and had nothing in possession to identify who he was.\\n\\nSo my grandma, who is now nearing ninety, is still going strong. Mentally and physically great besides just a walking stick. She lost four children at the ages of two, twelve, and twenty-seven. And a husband.\\n\\nI never met any of them because this, of course, all happened before I was born.\\n\\nThe ones who are still here is Alan, Frank, and my mother. My uncle Alan turned out to be okay. Frank, on the other hand, now in his sixties, is an abusive alcoholic who lives in a crummy apartment with whoknows and has two kids he never sees. He turned down rehab many times but my grandma once told me that he drinks because he blames himself for what happened to Johnny, since he was the one who introduced him to drugs. But he hates us and wants nothing to do with the rest of his family anymore. I've only seen him four times in my life, and he was abusive on two occasions. One time when we went for a family meal when I was six, he ruined the night by abusing the resterant staff.\\n\\nSo my mother and uncle Alan are the only people out of seven kids who turned out to have positive lives. Depressing as fuck, isn't it?\\n\\n\", \"My parents divorced when I was a kid, and I remained estranged from my father for a long time.

Every time I'm in the bathroom emptying my bladder and my mom has to go, and she rushes me to finish. It's not like I can't pee any faster, I swear my mom and brother are the only ones in the house who can be rude to me sometimes. When my brother plays his game and I want to tell him about something he gives me an attitude just because he's mad at the game since he sucks at video games (I don't know why he keeps playing the same game that he dies in a lot) or he just plains ignore. I think now I  know why I was never happy living at home. A lot of bad things happened to me in the house I grew up in. (it's a long story for another post).I'm more happier away from home than when I'm at home. The only time I feel like I get respected and treated nicely is when I'm with my boyfriend, my best friends, and my other family members.

Plus, she gets taken too and from school, and her parents chaperone her everywhere else, since she doesn\\'t have a car yet (they are making her work for her vehicle). As for him, his dad never leaves the house, and he has an \"open door\" rule, meaning they have to be where they can be seen and all doors open at all times at his house.\\n\\n\\nThe only time her parents aren\\'t watching her is when she\\'s with me, we hang out a lot on the weekend, so they let her spend the night at my house often, because of my situation on the weekends.\\n\\n\\nOn the weekends, my mother works late evening/nights, and she\\'s gone until almost 6 in the morning.

I can see now that it probably wasn\\'t my place to tell her that but I was only looking out for her and she used to appreciate advice like that from me in the past. \\n\\nThen she started pretty much ditching me for him and taking his side and telling him things that were private and I felt like she was slowly kicking me out and replacing me. And I told her that, but she didn\\'t see it because she had her new guy and it was kind of like she didn\\'t care because she had someone there for her.\\n\\nShe also lost a couple other friends before this happened pretty much due to the same reasons so I didn\\'t feel that bad at first because I was kind of like you know \"she did this to herself, she made this choice\". But now, I really miss her and I hate that we stopped being friends because I kind of need her.\\n\\nIm not sure what to do. She did actually text me about a month after we stopped talking and was like \"hey, I know we don\\'t talk anymore but I wanted to see how you are going\" and I actually ignored it because I was angry and didn\\'t care but now I kind of see it was a bitch move.

But I really want to make this right again.\\n\\nAny help would be really appreciated :)\\n', \"Me [28F] and my husband [29M] don't want children. His parents disagree with our decision so much that they want him to divorce me.\\nFor the past year, I've been weathering constant and continuous passive-aggressive attacks from my husband's parents. This issue has largely stemmed from our refusal to have children. They have also been contacting my parents, stating that they have issues with things we've said/done (mainly baby-related) and when we've tried bringing up the issue they lie and say they don't know what we're talking about and act like we're overreacting/being crazy/too sensitive. \\n\\n\\nRecently, after his parents did and said multiple things in a short period of time, my husband tried to confront them again (not for the first time). During the conversation, his parents said some truly horrible (and in my opinion, unforgivable) things about me: They said that my refusal to have children (which my husband totally supports, and agrees with as he also doesn't want children) made me an abusive, mentally ill, toxic person and told my husband to divorce me. They also gave him an ultimatum: them or me. The conversation was not received well by my husband, and he, of course, chose me. He's very angry with his parents as they've refused to listen to and respect his wishes. \\n\\n\\nHowever, they then decided to contact my parents to inform them of the mentally ill, toxic, abusive daughter that they'd raised because I wouldn't give them grandchildren. My parents, of course, were bewildered and tried to explain that we were happy, and that if we didn't want children, that decision should be respected. My husband's parents have not taken kindly to any of those suggestions.\\n\\n\\nMy husband and I have been together for five years, and are coming up to being married for three. I have made it clear to everyone involved that I don't want children, and I never have. My husband agreed and has always supported and agreed with this decision. \\n\\n\\nAt the moment, no one is really speaking to anyone, and I'm taking it rather hard. It's devastating to realise that his parents only ever liked or valued me as a 'person' when I was a uterus that was potentially giving them grandchildren. To hear from my parents that they're furious that I've disrupted the plans that they had for their son upsets me on so many levels that I can't even explain properly. I am no longer sleeping or eating properly. If it were me, and they weren't my husband's parents, I would cut them completely out of my life and never speak or associate with them again. While my husband feels like this is a great solution, I also feel that they are still his parents, and no matter how angry he currently is, he's going to want a relationship in the future. My question is - how do I do? How can I try and move forward with people who literally won't accept me unless I bear them grandchildren? How can I ever let go of the fact that they've made it abundantly clear to me, my husband, and my parents, that they view me as a uterus, not a person? I want to do the right thing by my husband and be supportive, but I'm completely lost in this situation, and I have honestly no idea how to move forward. \\n  \\n  ---   \\n  **tl;dr**: My in-laws won't speak to me because I don't want children. They've threatened my husband with an ultimatum (them or me) and have insisted he leaves me immediately. What do I do? What advice is there for trying to move forward - especially with people who won't address me unless I give them grandchildren? \", \"I don't care about my stepchild.\\nOkay. \\nSo I've been married for about 9 months or so. My wife had a kid from someone previously before me. He is two and a half now. I've never cared about him and don't give a shit about him. I know it's not right to say but it's how I feel. I've put up with it the past 2 years because I knew it was the right thing to do for her. We want to have a baby. I want to have a child now of my own but I'm afraid that I will never care for him whatsoever and will care and love my child and never care or love him. I don't know what to do anymore. Me and my wife have never had problems in our relationship or even an arguement. It's not her or us it's me personally. I hate the feeling of not caring. I'm trying to find a solution that doesn't end up with me leaving. But what do you do when you don't care about your step child? I need a solution to this fucked it problem. I care about her.

My sister studies in a university and comes back usually on weekends and then maybe some other days depending on her schedule. \\nWhen she comes back everyone in the house starts fighting and she\\'s the problem. When she\\'s home, everything we do is wrong. We were \"raised\" wrong. Mom \"spoils\" us. Mom doesn\\'t \"love\" her. We \"don\\'t want her here\". And when my mom says that she causes the problems she bursts into tears, goes to her room, cries for a bit and leaves to her boyfriends house because \"she feels loved there\". And that\\'s how it always goes. She comes back, says that my brother doesn\\'t do anything in this is house and that he\\'s a spoiled brat, fights over something, bursts into tears and leaves. She is very emotional. When she accuses my brother of something and he calls her some kind of name she immediately stars crying like it\\'s the end of the world. \\nLast night she texted my mom, saying that she raised us poorly and that mom doesn\\'t love her. She said that she\\'s gonna be leaving our home and won\\'t come back because \"we don\\'t want her there\". \\nOf course, me, as  the peace maker in the family, wrote her a huge message about how she is wrong, how we actually love her is just that she doesn\\'t see it and everything else.

We met in our college choir and are still in college, just for context.

I've had to resort to redirecting my attention when she's been going on too long. \\n\\nShe tells me the same, or similar stories a lot and has to give me all types of insignificant details that prolong her talking. Even when I bring to her attention she mentioned something before it usually never stops her from telling me again.

She is known by the family to be immature, selfish, and impulsive. She repeatedly burns bridges with family when she does not get her way and will give them the short end of a deal if it benefits her (ie. Not paying my financially struggling mother back on the multiple occasions of covering her rent or car payment because she decided to use her paycheck on a new TV or $200 purse). I'd love to not speak to her and never go to her place but because she is the mother of my 2 year old niece this is not possible. To give you some perspective, she has fights with my niece's father who got their old apartment raided by the police for selling heroin (finding heroin and a pistol in a safe in the apartment) to the point of yelling and hitting, even late at night when the child should be asleep, right in front of my niece. Because her father is soon going on trial and to prison for a long time (ex convict in possession of a firearm on top of selling heroin) and as previously stated, my sister being a half-assed parent, I am left to clean up after her when it comes to my niece. I have to be consistent in teaching her not to hit people and not to spit at them. Again, to give you some perspective, I am 15 years old and do not need the stress of making sure a child grows up to be a decent person on my plate. My sister has multiple DUI and assault charges which have resulted in her drivers license being revoked yet she continues to drive with my niece in the car even when everyone who knows her and cares about the child tells her not to. Although she is better now she is still a complete ass of a parent with her first kid dying before the age of one and losing custody of her two other sons about 9 years ago (older one being 13 and the other being 9). I am actually convinced her uterus is hexed because every time she has a kid shit goes horribly south which makes me terrified in the case of my niece. In the winter of 2016 my sister attempted suicide (my niece being just under 1) and while her drug dealer boyfriend screamed at her while she laid on the floor saying she wanted to die I had to make sure the child was still sleeping through all of it in the next room. Now although few and far apart, I've had my struggles with depression so I understand how difficult postpartum depression can be but even then I believe as a parent you always put the child first in every scenario. On top of everything else she completely spoils my niece buying her an unnecessary amount of toys and candy whenever she reaches for it at the store and I know she is not going to be able to handle it when my niece wants something at the mall my sister absolutely cannot afford at the moment and her entire worldview changes when she realizes she does not get everything she wants when she wants it. Although I mostly enjoy being alone and I have never been in a relationship I can only imagine possible significant others would not be totally understanding when I try to explain that my niece comes first which only adds to the stress and worry. To be clear, my sister is not neglectful and provides for my niece with everything a child needs such as diapers, food, bed, cleaning, etc. but if she continues this way (which I know she will) my niece will grow up with the same characteristics as my sister and it's just about all up to me to make sure that doesn't happen.

She would say she was busy, but the last day I texted her, my dad had kidney surgery because he had cancer in his kidney. They removed the whole kidney and the day he got home, I texted my childhood friend that he was home and he was doing okay. She couldnâ\\x80\\x99t even take one second to respond â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m glad your dad is okay?â\\x80\\x9d That was it for me, I had to remove her on Facebook after she had to replied after a week, two weeks, etc. and I believe I deleted all messages on my cell phone, and Iâ\\x80\\x99m not sure what happened ! Then this â\\x80\\x9cfriendâ\\x80\\x9d of mine, never messages me on either Instagram  or Facebook. I think it began when I told her I asked out one of her friends a year ago (we are still friends, the girl I asked out), and from then she started not to respond to me. So, recently I told my friend who I asked out, about the communication between me and her friend. She told me that her friend, (who is also her roommate)  that theyâ\\x80\\x99re both extremely busy, which I understand, but and that â\\x80\\x9csheâ\\x80\\x9d loves me, and doesnâ\\x80\\x99t hate me (my friend who doesnâ\\x80\\x99t respond, and not love in a boyfriend way.)

We got a call from the hospital and my wife and I drove 4.5 hours to spend the night with her in the hospital. While there she had to go to the bathroom but called a nurse because she had to use a bed pan. Just before she went she asked us to leave the room and my wife and I refused because we wanted to get a cute photo of her on the bed pan to post to Facebook and compare to a baby photo of her when she first learned how to pee. She got very upset and called the nurse and told her to remove us from the room. This upset us, especially my wife but we tried to keep out composure until she was released from the hospital.  We dropped her off at her apartment and my wife spent the 4.5 hour drive home crying because we can't believe how spoiled and selfish our daughter has become. \", 'How to disown my sister\\nHow do I remove my 18 year old sister from the family?

He had a very weird instagram that was filled with memes and weird facts. He also said that apples were more affective at waking you up than coffee. \\n\\nHe also randomly announced that he was at my school. We hung out, it was very weird. He was complaining about missing a bus most of the time and the cold. He also only wanted to talk about school. When we were texting he would respond with one word answers and never wanted to talk about anything. He didnt have any favorite tv shows and he didnt listen to music.\\n\\nHe was also antipot and was very judgey of people who smoked it. He only hung out with people who got good grades. \\n\\nHe was just very boring and complainey. He also never drank. He was also condescending.\\n ', 'Friend is badgering me to give them stuff, and frankly it\\'s making me feel less inclined to reciprocate.\\nSo.

Grath and I decide to do something together just the two of us. However, Orlando is a bit... *jealous*.

If say, Grath or Fallow decide to do something together, Orlando assumes he is being excluded on purpose and maliciously. \\n\\nSee, we basically want to be friends with each other, rather than being \"by association\". (ever hang out with a group of people, yet you realise the only reason you know some of them is because another person brings \\'em along? yeah.)

My uncle was pissed but accepted that it was rented. I also put into boxes all the things my grandad had willed my aunts and uncles for them to take away after the funeral - some couldnâ\\x80\\x99t bear to and I put it in storage for them to take at a later date. \\n\\nNow Iâ\\x80\\x99ve lived in my home since then and over the years changed the house to my taste and extended it. Unbeknownst to myself (until last night) each time I changed something my uncle has bad mouthed me to other family members and run me down, convincing others that I stole the house from them (was a rental property when my grandfather moved in and it was myself who purchased it). Over the years I have noticed that my family are not very communicative with me but Iâ\\x80\\x99ve put it down to initially my brothers death (4 years after my grandad) and then my mums (a few years later).

', \"Is this kind of family interaction normal?\\nHi all, I hope you can help me out. Is what my dad said to me normal? \\n\\nBackstory: I'm 24f...married...have a toddler. I was texting my mom today about several things (husband can get ribs on sale at work for them, MIL invited me and my mom to a play, things my MIL said that irritated me...etc. She was on break at work). At the end, she mentioned my dad is home sick today. Maybe I should call him. So I call him and ask him jokinging why he's sick. He said he has the flu or a cold or something. He stayed home yesterday too. Then he mumbled something offhand about how mom wasn't going to tell me because I never ask them how they are. \\n\\nDo normal parents do/say stuff like that? Won't tell their kid that one if them are sick because they don't ask how they are? It makes me feel terrible but also manipulated. It's not like my mom has never given me the silent treatment because she thinks I don't call enough. \\n\\nThe thing is...I HATE small talk. I never ask anyone how they are. It feels fake and wrong to me(maybe because I don't think most people actually care about me). They(anyone) can tell me if they don't feel good. I wouldn't wait til asked to tell my close family/friends if I don't feel well. I also have social anxiety and anxiety in general. These kinds of comments make me want to call them even less. I already feel judged every time I call my mom. And I still get anxious every time my dad calls...thinking he is calling to yell or something. I just CAN'T ask. It literally feel impossible. Like I physically can't get the words out. \\n\\nComments? Anything to make feel better? I feel down and don't like myself.

I don't have any real friends, I just have acquaintances, if you will, people who I see in school mostly and spend some time with occasionally, I find myself to be happier this way since I could focus more on what I like most (Science and music) I basically spend a vast majority of my time alone even when I go out to the cinema or to get dinner I have no one but myself, I was like this since I was a kid, so due to this my social skills aren't great, I turn red most of the times when I speak to new people and just wish I'd turn into a tree just so I could escape the situation. However, I can speak on a stage in front of thousands of people if I had to, as long as it is not a direct interaction or I already know the people I'm speaking with, I am good.\\n\\nWith that said, over the past year, I found myself trapped in a social situation beyond my understanding, I genuinely don't fully understand how this relationship (If you could call it that in the first place) developed in the first place but here is a recap of what happened. A little bit over a year ago in my school. Some guy and I sat around the same table in the library, this happened because the library was packed that day and there was no other place other than that table, so we just sat opposite to eachother not saying a word, and I'm pretty sure each one of us didnt know that the other existed in the first place, days went by and everyday I went to the library I'd sit in the same place and the same goes for him, even when the library was completely empty we'd sit in the exact same place, by this time we knew eachother but never spoke a single word I guess we got used to eachother and if a day went by without one of us being there I'm pretty sure we'd feel a bit blue. By the time we were done with our exams we stopped coming to the library and did not see each other that often until our classes got moved and my homeroom happened to be just opposite of his, and this is where the bollocks started, we got to see one another way more often, In the corridor, the bathroom, on the way out to the buses, and as we passed by eachother, we'd always just stare at eachother still not speaking a single word, we both know eachother but pretended that we didn't. We would find our selves in group conversations since we have mutual friends, we still wouldn't directly speak but if I say a joke he's going to laugh and vice versa. I developed some kind of liking for this guy, I almost consider him to be a friend although we never spoke, I'd like to say hi, but as I said before I will probably turn so red that I'd melt, and even if I was courageous enough and had the social skills to do so I don't even know if he wants to talk maybe he doesn't like me or consider me a friend, maybe I'm just an obnoxious kid he sees way too often. Now we see each other every day in the morning, I don't know how the hell it happens but we go to the restroom at the same exact time in the morning (I guess we both arrive at the same time).

I donâ\\x80\\x99t have many friends and thatâ\\x80\\x99s because I always feared that a friend would know me and just completely hate me. So I only had like two or three friends for this reason. Then I was diagnosed with depression, so I tried to tell my best friend at the time that I had depression and that over the last year or so that may be why I had done some weird drastic things (in this time I never did anything to harm my friend emotionally or physically). While I was telling him he became hostile towards me and then told who told his girlfriend who in turn became hostile towards me and told me I was a shit person (A shit father and a shit boyfriend). That was 3 months ago. So I stopped talking to them because of that I tried going to my closest friend about something I never talked about ever to anyone and it caused them to walk away. Then I sought out help and I started to recover from the issue the and I made regular updates about on Facebook because I was finally ready to talk about my issue, but one day when I said I lost a friend him and the other person I thought was my friend attacked me in the comments because I made a side comment about what happened between us.

Mostly for my studies, but also because I simply want to move out. I already tried last year but they found a housing for young girls managed by nuns, so I lived here for a while, but I felt uneasy the whole time. \\nI'm heavily depressed and I had to drop out of school this year. My parents told me to come back home so that I could recover, which I did, but they don't approve of me going anywhere else to do so. For example, I feel really good in my boyfriend's family (he doesn't live with them anymore but I'm still very close to them) and wish to spend more time there, but my parents don't like the idea of not being able to give me the kind of comfort I need and find over there, so they'd rather have me stay home.\\nI have spent as little time as possible in my parents' house recently, using every opportunity to get away, and it is understandable they don't like it. But I have always been a solitary kid, and now with my depression it became worse. I don't connect with my parents or any of my 4 siblings, and spending time with them feels like a chore. Communicating within the family is quite rough. And whenever I do try to explain how I feel, it becomes overwhelmingly clear that I'm in the wrong. It feels like whatever I say about feeling bad within the family is deflected by stating my parents and siblings' good intents. I'm sure they do mean well, but I now doubt even my own reasons for wanting anything but staying with them. I can't identify the reason why I don't feel easy with them, because they're all trying their best to help me through those tough times. I feel like an ungrateful brat. \\nI'm not really confrontational either. I usually obey and agree to avoid stirring conflict, but this is getting tiring. \\nIf any of you has been in a similar situation, how can you open the dialogue? How can I tell my parents I don't feel good spending much time with them? In my family, direct family should come before everything. I also don't know how to talk about moving out and have a studio instead of being placed in a student housing, especially since my big sister (25) still lives at home despite having a job. It's not a matter of money either. I come from a middle class family and the housing my parent chose for me this year is much more expensive than a studio.

So now we're in february she has a renewed contract at work and isn't looking at places to live.  Little things she does around the house bug me, but thats probably just because its our home and not a shared rental.  However recently I've suffered a string of ill health (multiple hospital admissions) and now i'm home I just want my own space! She has cut her work hours to look for a new job but barely looks and just sits around the house.  I feel like i'm cleaning up after her all the time, plus she is always eating our food.

They do not understand the concept of privilege, think everyone on welfare is lazy, voted for Trump and defend him and every time I get legitimately pissed off at them, they say that the school I went to brainwashed me and made me crazy and in doing so they completely invalidate all the hard work and effort I had to put in not only to get into this school, but working two jobs while there and still maintaining a 3.5 GPA. I was a sociology major, too, so these issues are literally what I spent most of my four years studying. It's now at the point where I cannot have a conversation with my father without it blowing up. It gets worse by the issue and the WORST part is that they are decent and loving people. Is there anyone else on here who is in a similar situation? What do you do? I'm slowly losing my mind trying to argue at this point. And moving out is the obvious solution, but I don't just want to run away from people who disagree with me and like, I don't pay rent.\", 'Alcoholic dad\\nIt\\'s been like this since I was 6 years old. Just to give information, my family and I lived on a farm before I was six and I rarely got into contact with people outside of my family so I barely knew how to talk and would rather screech and be mad all the time and this led me to be very bad at my own language and have few \"real\" friends. My dad\\'s problem started when he started drinking after the company he worked in shutdown I didn\\'t know about it but my family fought about it without my knowing and I don\\'t even know my siblings that well due to me never having gotten any real attention I just sat in my room while they fought at age six and played a game of Madagascar and shut it out I started understanding at age 10 how bad I was with actual relationships i barely know even now how to initiate discussions with other people or relatives and cryed, everyone started to fight at age 11 now at age 16 my dad drove me and my friend from my other friends due to us having had a LAN (played games) and he almost drove right into the railing of a bridge and that was today now that it wasn\\'t just me who was endangered because of his fucking problem I started getting mad. He barely cares what I say and what my mom says he probably wants to leave my mom but doesn\\'t have the financial expertise or job to do so. I dont know what to do and I barely have the guts to cut myself or anything just banging my head into a wall when my parents aren\\'t home or watching people play games.

We have been friends for almost 7 years now. 2 years ago, I (26) started dating my current bf (35). During that time, I was playing hard to get, and I was not really interested in my bf at the time so I would talk about him to my male friend who is in the relationship with my other friend. At one point, my friend told me that my bf is a sucker for love because he was chasing a girl that didn't want him...fastfoward...I accidentally told my bf that my friend called him a sucker and my bf said he doesn't want me being friends with him anymore. When my friend and I spoke about my bf, my bf and I were just dating, we were not bf and gf so I don't think my bf should taken it to the extent that I shouldnt be friends with him. Regardless....the point is that idk how to tell my friend that I can't be friends with him anymore...and if I'm not friends with him than his gf, which is my friend too, is not going to be my friends anymore...I feel bad because they are always asking to go out with us but they don't know the arguments I had with my bf regarding this matter. I feel stuck in this situation and I need your assistance. Thanks \", 'My friend is ruining her frienships\\nI\\'m not really sure what to do here.\\nMy best friend, let\\'s call her Sam, has lost a lot of friendships recently. And I mean a lot. In the past two years, she\\'s lost almost every close friendship she\\'s ever had. The count is in the double digits. Something would happen and she\\'d declare them dead to her and never speak to them again. Unfortunately, I find myself usually feeling like it\\'s Sam\\'s fault that the friendships are crumbling.\\nRecently, she\\'s started shamelessly using her friends. One girl worked as a seamstress at a community theater in her free time and Sam would constantly arrive unannounced and drop off clothes she wanted tailored, imposing absurd timeline, even saying she\\'d be back that night to pick the dresses up. When her friend finally asked Sam to start paying, Sam announced to everyone that their friendship was over and that she refused to associate with someone who didn\\'t view her as a friend.\\nShe\\'s started yelling at people for not texting her more. She called one of her now former friends, an elementary school teacher, and yelled at her for not responding to her texts about where they were going to get dinner that night. She wanted to make sure she didn\\'t eat the same type of food for lunch. The teacher cancelled and they haven\\'t spoken since.\\nAnd unfortunately, with each new friend lost, her demands on those remaining have become more and more extreme. Her need for attention has gotten out of hand. She demands that we all hang out four nights a week and constantly accuses people of not valuing her friendship enough if they can\\'t make it. One friend spent every night with her one week trying to show Sam that she mattered. When the friend didn\\'t continue that schedule the next week, Sam screamed at them for pulling away and called her a coward for not just ending it if she didn\\'t want to be friends.\\nWorst of all, she accuses people of saying things they\\'ve never said, claiming that she\\'s stupid, she can read between the lines. And when people try to explain that they never intended to hurt or upset her, she claims that it doesn\\'t matter what they said. What matters is how she was made to feel.\\nIt shouldn\\'t come as a surprise that Sam has serious self-esteem issues. She\\'s in therapy and has been for a while, trying to work on them. Unfortunately, she goes back and forth between crying that no one knows how hard it is to live with \"being such a failure\" and accusing others of not being deserving of her friendship.\\nI want to be there for her. I want to help. She\\'s been my best friend and she used to be able to be there for me, but I\\'m not sure I can handle who she\\'s become and how she\\'s started treating us.\\ntl;dr: My friend has serious self-esteem issues and is ruining all of her friendships because she treats everyone like absolute garbage. She\\'s getting therapeutic help but I\\'m not sure I\\'m able to stick around long enough for things to get better.', 'Best guy friend is ignoring me, and I don\\'t understand why\\nMy best guy friend \"Jake\" (not his real name) have known each other for 14 years. We are now both 19 years old. Of all the friends I currently have, I\\'ve been friends with Jake the longest. We first met in kindergarten. I used to be really chubby and shy when I was much younger, so I got picked on a lot. Jake was my only friend back when I was in elementary school and middle school, and he stood up for me a lot back then. In high school, I started to grow out of my childhood awkwardness, lost a significant amount of weight, and managed to find a small group of friends in my school\\'s anime club. Throughout all this, Jake was a very steady, loyal, and supportive friend, and I\\'m forever grateful to him for that. We ended up getting into different colleges, both around an hour away from our hometown. Even though things got somewhat busy at times, we kept in regular contact and found time to hang out when we were both in our hometown at the same time.\\nRecently, I met a great guy \"Aaron\" (not his real name) in college. We started dating. I wanted him to meet my friends from back home, so I arranged a time to meet for dinner. During our meetup (I invited 3 friends from high school, including Jake), I noticed that Jake was unusually quiet. He didn\\'t say much of anything during our dinner. I thought it was a bit weird because he is normally really talkative (I\\'m usually the quieter one in our friendship), so I pulled him aside and asked him what\\'s wrong. He said nothing, so I figured nothing was wrong.  \\nThat meetup was two months ago. About two weeks ago, I reached out to Jake on Facebook to ask him how things are going and to try to catch up on life. He completely ignores all my messages. I tried texting him to ask if he\\'s mad at me. No response. I don\\'t understand. I feel completely blindsided by this because Jake has never gone more than one day without responding to my messages. A mutual friend told me that she always suspected that Jake liked me, but I highly doubt that. He never showed any signs of liking me back when we were in high school, and he had a couple of girlfriends in high school. He\\'s not the shy type, so I highly doubt he would be the type of guy to hide his feelings for so many years.  ', 'How do I reconcile with a failed friendship from the past\\nEarlier this year, I met a Colombian woman in my state and failed at my attempts to date her; many of our disagreements surrounded my personal history of morbid obesity.  Although I am 5\\'9\\'\\' and now weight around 240 lbs, I have weighed nearly 400 lbs as a teenager and young adult.\\n\\nWe dined together and talked to each other for around two weeks.  Within that timeframe, I became very disaffected by her constant criticisms of other men she dated, such as her issues with their hygiene, lack of direction, etc.  After talking to her nearly everyday, she suddenly asked me \"Do you think we\\'re dating?... I think we can only be friends.\"  I immediately parted ways with her, informed her of my thoughts on her demanding and emotionally draining ways, very bluntly told her that I didn\\'t like her, and directed her to no longer communicate with me.\\n\\nAfter another two weeks, she texted me out of the blue and said she \"understood\" my anger, asked to reconnect saying that she though I was a \"beautiful\" person, and eventually informed me that her \"biggest concern was my weight.\"  After another month, we went out (with me spending money for gas, etc.) and explored multiple regions in my state.  She kept encouraging me to lose weight and gave me a diet book.  Within the last times we spoke, she confided in me that she was an undocumented immigrant and told me - in anguished tears - about a failed marriage here in the U.S., as well as unwanted sexual encounters she faced here.   I offered my help, but she declined any of my attempts to reconcile her immigration status.  After another week, I became very depressed about not meeting specific weight targets.  I eventually broke down, said I felt \"less than human,\" and asked if we could postpone any further in-person meetings until I could lose enough weight.  Over the weekend, she ignored my texts; I drove to her home to see if she was okay and noticed her car was parked outside.\\n\\nShe eventually texted me, saying that I was a person with \"unfriendly attitudes\" sometimes.  Later in the day, she told me that hearing me talk of my weight was tiring.  I was so baffled I couldn\\'t get out a response.  After that, she told me that  I am \"too sensitive,\" looked at the criticism as an insult, and then mockingly told me \"everything hurts you, everything affects you.\"  I told her that ignoring me was inherently wrong and hung up.  She then gave me a long text ending that I should \"just be happy... happiness isn\\'t just about body image.\"  \\n\\nI need advice on how to handle situations like this.  My gut reaction was to tell her she was a \"selfish bitch\" and hang up the phone.  Looking back, that\\'s probably what I needed to do, because that\\'s exactly what I was thinking at the time.\\n\\nSecondly, I need to really reevaluate a relationship with a therapist who told me that cutting her off the first time I did was the wrong thing to do.   I am holding a serious grudge against him, particularly as I don\\'t trust him anymore.\\n\\nIn sum, I am unhappy in life - because of shit like this.  I try to be a good person and deal with human turds.  But I need to be strong enough to break out of it rather than be a victim.', 'I think my friends ditched me.\\nI was recently doing a mass unfollowing on Instagram and I noticed a lot of people that I went to high school and college with are no longer following me. Same thing with Facebook. I donâ\\x80\\x99t blame them because Iâ\\x80\\x99m boring and they are either married with kids or theyâ\\x80\\x99re just out to the hottest bar or club every damn weekend. I donâ\\x80\\x99t drink nor am I in a relationship or married. Where does a 29 year old go to make new friends and even find the love of their life? I failed to find her in school or work. Am I just doomed to roam the planet a loner who only can have internet friends. Sure itâ\\x80\\x99s cool at first but I need real friends to talk to and someone to marry for real.

She is now a lot older and I have seen her a couple of years ago but we have lost contact all of a sudden. I never use to be allowed to speak to her because apparently she was trouble.

Iâ\\x80\\x99d really prefer to go upstairs to the bedrooms. My mom really wants me to sit with them... but Iâ\\x80\\x99m just too exhausted. I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to spend an hour and a half on a folding chair OR on the floor. I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to watch this TV show - they can watch it but Iâ\\x80\\x99m just not interested.

But then, I had to leave for a different high school while she stayed with most of our friends. We didnâ\\x80\\x99t grow apart, but we spent most of our time with different people, which can change a person. Iâ\\x80\\x99d like to think that I did not change a whole lot (probably true :â\\x80\\x99) ) but my best friend has been hanging out with some of our friends and theyâ\\x80\\x99ve been affecting her attitude in a way, and sheâ\\x80\\x99s starting to become the same people we would always laugh at for being stupid and ignorant and petty. We talked about it and she agrees thatâ\\x80\\x99s sheâ\\x80\\x99s changed, but doesnâ\\x80\\x99t want her change to affect our friendship.

The kitchen is always set buffet style to make it easy for everyone to serve themselves. I always make sure to make my guest bedroom is welcoming. Like fluffy pillows, comfy comforter, extra linens, working tv. You get the idea. \\n\\nWhenever my FIL comes to visit it irks TF out of me when he makes these little adjustments while heâ\\x80\\x99s here. I recently noticed that heâ\\x80\\x99ll blow out the candle in the bathroom. Like WTF?! I know this cause I went in there before and after him once. Heâ\\x80\\x99ll also just randomly walk over to turn off my hallway lamp when heâ\\x80\\x99s only been here for like 20 minutes.

If itâ\\x80\\x99s not feel free to direct me!  To sum it up,  Iâ\\x80\\x99ve highly offended a family member of mine.  I wrote this apology that I canâ\\x80\\x99t bring myself to send them.  I kept telling them how much I wanted to see them and I even flew up to see everyone.  When we were all seated at a restaurant I was having really bad anxiety and didnâ\\x80\\x99t really speak to anyone.  He took this really personal and felt I came off as an asshole.  I didnâ\\x80\\x99t know how to explain the anxiety part of things to him so I gave him a lame excuse about eating spoiled food the night before.  While it was true it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t the reason I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t speaking to anyone.  Then I had went to his house to try and speak to him as I was leaving the next day and he told me not to come.  I did anyway and you can imagine that didnâ\\x80\\x99t end well at all.  He wonâ\\x80\\x99t talk to me.  I finally found the courage to type up this apology.  It explains the conditions I suffer from, how theyâ\\x80\\x99re debilitating and the trauma I endured that caused them.  The apology I feel is oversharing but I also wanted to explain myself in full and be as genuine as I possibly can.   Nobody knows the things I went through but Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to post the apology here for you guys to read for yourselves.  Please donâ\\x80\\x99t judge me too harshly I just donâ\\x80\\x99t want this family member to never talk to me again.   I understand it may come off as a pity me type of thing but I promise itâ\\x80\\x99s not.  \\n\\nHere it is :\\n\\n\\nI just wanted to let you how sorry I am.  I shouldâ\\x80\\x99ve apologized sooner but I wanted to give you time.  Iâ\\x80\\x99d like to fully explain myself.  This is really long but itâ\\x80\\x99s genuine.  And Iâ\\x80\\x99m not justifying myself in any way as I fully understand that Iâ\\x80\\x99ve crossed boundaries and disrespected you but I also want you to have a better understanding of what really happened.  Hear me out before you roll your eyes at what Iâ\\x80\\x99m about to say.   Some of this wonâ\\x80\\x99t make any sense initially.  But trust me it all ties together.  Whatever decision you make Iâ\\x80\\x99d prefer for you not to tell anyone any of this stuff.  This is why I handled certain things the way I did.  Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been through a lot of trauma.  Initially it was with Savannahâ\\x80\\x99s dad.  He would beat me, kick me, slap, choke, etc told me my mother would be happy with me gone.  And she was aware and didnâ\\x80\\x99t do anything.  This was when Jody had custody of me but I was visiting them when they had an apartment together.  Eventually I went to live with my dad and his parents.  His mom didnâ\\x80\\x99t want any more kids and she was absolutely terrible to me.  Sheâ\\x80\\x99d give me Valium to sedate me, swing pots and pans at me, threaten me with knives, lock me out of the house etc.  My dad wasnâ\\x80\\x99t any better as he gave me my first black eye.  School was really difficult as Iâ\\x80\\x99d get bullied pretty bad and Iâ\\x80\\x99d get myself suspended just to avoid it.  At this point people claimed I had a behavioral issue and I was put on multiple medications I didnâ\\x80\\x99t need.  His mom was able to collect SSI because of this and when Jody found this out she wanted me back.  After a year back and forth to court she won custody in January 2014.  I was 15 at this point.  She promised me a better life but it only got worse.  She kept me locked up in the house for 4 years as she didnâ\\x80\\x99t want me improving and losing the SSI.  Her boyfriend also lived there, he was an alcoholic.  Heâ\\x80\\x99d break into my room in the middle of the night to beat and rape me.  Taunt me about how Iâ\\x80\\x99ve made previous suicide attempts and would go on about how heâ\\x80\\x99d kill me but he figured Iâ\\x80\\x99d do it myself anyway.  Iâ\\x80\\x99ve never told anyone as I figured nobody would ever believe me.  Anyway, I was diagnosed with depression, PTSD, Panic Disorder, and social anxiety, and yet most people arenâ\\x80\\x99t aware of a lot of the things Iâ\\x80\\x99m telling you right now.  Because of some of these conditions itâ\\x80\\x99s hard for me to socialize with people for the first time.  I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t trying to be distant or cold to you in person but my anxiety makes me seem that way and Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry.  Itâ\\x80\\x99s something Iâ\\x80\\x99m trying to work on.  In fact it was so bad at one point I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t even able to eat in a restaurant.  I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t open the door if I ordered food.  I was constantly living in fear of being injured, killed, judged, any situation I was faced with Iâ\\x80\\x99d think of the worst possible scenario.  Itâ\\x80\\x99s even preventing me from getting a license.  Now, when you said I was chatty in text and not in person it really hurt my feelings and I wanted to explain but how do I explain this to somebody?  If I just said oh I have anxiety I felt as if it wouldâ\\x80\\x99ve sounded like bs.  And I just felt absolutely terrible and I acted on an impulse and I just ended up disrespecting you and crossed boundaries I never shouldâ\\x80\\x99ve in the first place and I am so so sorry for that.  Some of the things Aunt Connie said to me I took it to heart when I shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t have and it was another contributing factor as to why I had left.  The spoiled meat story was true it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t a lie.  I ate it around 1 in the morning she didnâ\\x80\\x99t give it to me I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t implying she did.  But it wasnâ\\x80\\x99t what made me not say much.  If you were wondering why I had my luggage itâ\\x80\\x99s because I figured youâ\\x80\\x99d be mad,  but let me in.  I didnâ\\x80\\x99t have enough money to uber all the way back so thatâ\\x80\\x99s why I brought my stuff.  It was idiotic I know.  Iâ\\x80\\x99m sorry.  Also,  I realize Iâ\\x80\\x99ve done things prior to this that have annoyed you.  And if I could get another chance I promise I wonâ\\x80\\x99t do those things again.   Sorry for those things as well.  I understand if you find it strange for me to tell you all of this but Iâ\\x80\\x99m sick of people not understanding how hard it is to deal with anxiety.  I wish I could do what normal people do without having racing thoughts and feeling like Iâ\\x80\\x99m about to pass out or worry about what people think of me or feel theyâ\\x80\\x99re laughing at me.  I wish I was normal but Iâ\\x80\\x99m not.  There isnâ\\x80\\x99t an off switch.  Granted they donâ\\x80\\x99t know all of this but now that you do I hope you believe me when I say itâ\\x80\\x99s not an excuse.  If you have any questions about this stuff or anything in general you can ask I just hope youâ\\x80\\x99re not mad at me anymore.  And maybe if possible I could come up again in a few months and try again ?  I know I gave a really bad first impression and itâ\\x80\\x99s hard to shake that but Iâ\\x80\\x99d like to try and fix that as well.  Plus I never really got to know you all that well like I did with Aunt Connie and Uncle Paul.   And she basically told me Iâ\\x80\\x99m never welcome there again because I left.  I mean we texted but you get what Iâ\\x80\\x99m saying right ?  This is long and now Iâ\\x80\\x99m rambling sorry but I feel so much better now that Iâ\\x80\\x99ve said all this it was bothering me.  I just donâ\\x80\\x99t have too many people in life right now.  And I know even when I first started talking to you on Facebook I would you send you pictures of alcohol and talk about drugs and I want to briefly go into that.  I was never hooked on anything hard.  I watched my mom lose everything from her health to her kids.  I did smoke weed, cigs, drink, and xannies.   I lived with an older cousin who pressured me but at the same time it was a way to escape my pain.   It wasnâ\\x80\\x99t easy watching my mom nod out and Aunt abuse my brothers and sisters and only keep them for money.   And being stuck in that house everyday and dealing with an alcoholic.   I was never necessarily hooked on anything besides cigarettes but I didnâ\\x80\\x99t want to look 40 by 30 so I quit those too.  It overall made my mental health even worse.   I finally cut all of that out and thatâ\\x80\\x99s when I heavily turned to food.  Then I gained almost 100 lbs and that was another reason I didnâ\\x80\\x99t wanna talk to anyone because I felt absolutely disgusting but Iâ\\x80\\x99ve lost most of it now!  Iâ\\x80\\x99m back down to 180.  12 pounds until Iâ\\x80\\x99m a healthy weight.  But my point is Iâ\\x80\\x99m not that kid anymore I promise you.  I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t even when I went up there thereâ\\x80\\x99s just more to everything than you initially see ya know?  And Iâ\\x80\\x99m not my mom I would never ask you for a dime.  I promise you Iâ\\x80\\x99m not a bad person if you really get to know me.  Iâ\\x80\\x99ve just had a lot of things I had to go through and I feel pretty much broken as a person but Iâ\\x80\\x99m trying to put myself back together itâ\\x80\\x99s really difficult but I donâ\\x80\\x99t have any choice but to go forward.  Believe me I still want to end it sometimes but I somehow manage to keep pushing on every day.   Talking to you, and Aunt Connie, and Uncle Paul made me feel like I had a chance of having some decent family members you know?  And I donâ\\x80\\x99t really know you all that well to say how you are as a person but you seemed really nice.  And then I screwed it up with everyone.  It just made me feel like Iâ\\x80\\x99d finally have what I always wanted and I shouldâ\\x80\\x99ve been realistic as I didnâ\\x80\\x99t grow up with you guys, none of you know me like that, and I shouldâ\\x80\\x99ve kept myself in line.  I just hope that youâ\\x80\\x99d be willing to give me a second chance.  Again, I genuinely am sorry for all the unnecessary drama Iâ\\x80\\x99ve brought into your life.   But, Iâ\\x80\\x99m really lonely and Iâ\\x80\\x99d love to have some family that doesnâ\\x80\\x99t hurt me.  I tried to explain the anxiety to Aunt Connie but she didnâ\\x80\\x99t get it.  She thought I was just being rude whenever there was company or I was at her brothers house.  Of course I didnâ\\x80\\x99t tell her everything I told you because I didnâ\\x80\\x99t feel comfortable.  And itâ\\x80\\x99s still uncomfortable telling you all of this but I felt that I owed you a proper explanation.  I mean I kept talking about how I wanted to see you and then didnâ\\x80\\x99t even speak to you in person how much of an asshole I probably came off as. ', 'Unsure how to talk to friend about something they\\'re doing, or well, not doing. [Advice]\\nFirst time poster in need of a bit of advice. Sorry this\\'ll be long.\\n\\nSo basically, I\\'ve been having a bit of an issue with a friend of mine, we\\'ve been friends for around 3 years at this point and everything was great! We\\'d talk every day and hang out around once a week/2 weeks depending on schedules and [my] kids schedules etc.  Then about 8(ish) months ago, she got a new boyfriend, and of course I\\'m really happy for her, she deserves all the happiness! \\n\\nThing is though, over the last 5 months, there\\'s been a steep decline in conversation between myself, said friend and another friend.  Friend #2 and I have been making ALL the effort to make plans with friend #1 and we\\'re getting almost nothing back.  We\\'ll text her and we\\'ll not hear anything for days, but she\\'s on Facebook or snapchat posting pictures of her and her new boyfriend, and when she does text back, it\\'s a totally one sided conversation. Like I\\'ll ask her maybe \"how have you been\" and I;ll get a page of text about how she has been with BF and what they\\'ve been doing and at the end it\\'ll be \"okay, I got to go, bye!\"\\nIf I don\\'t specifically ask her about her baby (who I adore, she\\'s like my niece) I don\\'t hear about her, at all. It\\'s all about BF.\\n\\nRecently, Friend #1 and I didn\\'t see each other for just over 3 months! (did I mention she lives 20 minutes away from me?) No matter how many times I asked her over, offered to go to her house, offered to take her to coffee etc, either the invite went unacknowledged, or she wanted to spend the time with her BF. \\nAt that point, I was a bit annoyed but, I understood that people have lives and sometimes things just don\\'t match up.\\nHowever, the reason I\\'m looking for advice is because, after not seeing her for 3 months and talking to her only a handful of times, she hits me up and asks if I can watch her baby so she can go out with another friend. (who wasn\\'t even going, she took her BF) \\nI said yes, as I know how it is to want to go out and not to have a babysitter, so my husband and I watched baby over night for her.\\nThe ONLY thing I said to her was that I had plans the next day after 1 so I needed her to be back before then. (spoiler: she wasn\\'t!) So I couldn\\'t do my plans and asked friend #1 to stay and hangout since I hadn\\'t seen her for so long. \\nIn the 1 hour(!) that she stayed, she called my sister (who I had plans with - we were meant to take my youngest out for his birthday, because friend hadn\\'t come back yet, my sister took him out by herself) a freak!  She said 3 times \"imagine not waiting for you!\" \\nI said to her, we\\'ll it\\'s because you weren\\'t back and she blamed traffic for being 2 hours late...\\n\\nOn top of the main incident, there\\'s been an incident where she brought a stranger to my house (after I told her I didn\\'t like strangers in my house or around my children) and expected me to be okay with it!  She dropped the bomb of bringing this stranger to my house 15 minutes before they arrived and told them I didn\\'t want them there so they felt awkward! (I did try really hard to make them feel welcome, and thankfully the kids had plans so they weren\\'t put in the situation)\\n\\nThe advice I\\'m seeking is  - A. How do I talk to friend #1 about this without coming off as bitchy or upsetting her.  and B. Should I keep being friends with her?   I don\\'t like to give up on a friendship, but I feel like she only wanted me around when she wanted something from me. \\n\\nAny advice is welcome, even if it\\'s me being weird or whatever.\\nThanks guys.', 'Friends don\\'t seem to want to do anything unless I do all the work?\\nI\\'ve been running into this problem a lot lately. If I don\\'t pull all the weight around my friends, nothing happens. \\n\\nAdmittedly these are, yes, all online friends. I don\\'t really have \"Realside\" friends any more. It\\'s complicated.\\n\\nWhat I mean is- if I don\\'t start a conversation, there will be no conversation. If there\\'s a lull in the conversation, I\\'ve got to fill it or the conversation ends there. If I make plans with my friends (Usually to play a game, watch a movie, something like that) there\\'s a 90% chance they\\'ll forget, or just lose interest, or ignore it. And a 10% chance they\\'ll halfass it when it happens. \\n\\nWhat the hell am I doing wrong? I can\\'t be sparklingly, Vegas-Light-Display interesting 24-7, it\\'s fucking exhausting. But if I\\'m not, I\\'m alone.', \"Need advice on helping a friend escape an abusive dad\\nA week ago, my best friend Jake (not his real name) confided in me that he has been physically and emotionally abused by his father since childhood. We are both 17 years old and we have been best friends for 4 years. I was really shocked when I found out because everyone in our high school friend circle sees him as extremely seemingly cheerful and upbeat. I'm his best friend, and I never suspected anything was wrong. \\nThis morning, he texted me saying that he was running away from home. He told me he left his home with a backpack full of clothes and $100 that he had secretly saved up without his dad's knowledge. I'm very worried about him. On the one hand, I think he should get out of that dangerous situation as soon as possible. On the other hand, I think it will be very difficult for him to survive on his own with so little money.

I thought that all my friends disliked me because I am mean to them, but for a solid 2-3 days I was the nicest I had been to anyone for what I remember, I asked all my friends how their days were, bought them food, listened to them. And it worked, they all are my very good friends now, but there is just one problem, the person who I considered my BEST friend is being a dick. Once I get attached to someone itâ\\x80\\x99s hard for me to let go. For example, in my previous relationship, I hated my gf, and I hated being with her, talking to her, I found her annoying, I never broke up with her, then, one day she decidedI was neglecting her so she said she wanted to break up, I begged her to stay even though I hated everything about her. We still end up breaking up, afterwards I was soo happy. Now, this person who I considered to be my BEST friend makes fun of me all the time for getting dumped by a girl and saying â\\x80\\x9cyou got left by an ugly girl for a gay guy.â\\x80\\x9d This sentence aline can tell you about his personality and how bad of a person he is. Today, my scho went to a ski park, I enjoyed my day, had fun, everythkng was fine. On the bus ride back to school, I was talking to my so called â\\x80\\x9cbest friend.â\\x80\\x9d He randomly went up to a girl I didnâ\\x80\\x99t know and told her I liked her, she then said â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t care.â\\x80\\x9d I donâ\\x80\\x99t know if this was a rejection or just a simple â\\x80\\x9cI donâ\\x80\\x99t careâ\\x80\\x9d but I didnâ\\x80\\x99t really care because I didnâ\\x80\\x99t find her attractive at all. I laugh it off and end up saying the word â\\x80\\x9cnigga.â\\x80\\x9d Now, I am what you would call a mulatto. I am bi-racial, half black, half white. After I said this word, a girl sitting behind me called me a racist. I then say that iâ\\x80\\x99m half black and she says â\\x80\\x9cI know.â\\x80\\x9d This was embarrassing, I get made fun of a lot because of the tone of my skin and my ethnicity, itâ\\x80\\x99s one if the things that still get to me. Moving on, he proceeds to point at me and laugh, then, scream at me saying I got rejected by the girl I didnâ\\x80\\x99t even like or ask out. I stood up on the bus and accidentally touched a girlâ\\x80\\x99s tit, she got very mad and I apologized but you could tell she was still mad. We get to school and he starts pushing me into doors and lockers, he is much bigger than me and I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t really push him back easily. The day ends then we take the bus back home, me and this kid are on the same bus and he says, â\\x80\\x9cyouâ\\x80\\x99re gross, nobody likes you and you got rejected by the ugliest girl in school. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s why you got dumped by an ugly bitch.â\\x80\\x9d And he walked away, as iâ\\x80\\x99m walking home, I was talking to some friends and they treat me like a fucking human, they were nice, didnâ\\x80\\x99t insult me, and treated me nicely. I got home and here I an, what should I do, he has managed to get the whole school to believe I am a perv, racist, ugly, nobody. Itâ\\x80\\x99s actually funny, he was the first person to ever talk to me, he was nice to me but after a while it just turned out he was a bad person, I wish one of the other guys were first to approach me, iâ\\x80\\x99d have much better friends. What do I do, itâ\\x80\\x99s one one of the hardest things to dispel gossip, everybody thought I was gay when I first came to the school, I got a girlfriend, suspicion gone, but how am I gunna disprove im not racist, not a perv, and how the hell am I supposed to deal with this â\\x80\\x9cfriendâ\\x80\\x9d if mine?', \"I am socially awkward and I find it so hard to get close to people?\\nI have very few friends. Basically one good friend and a bunch of people that i started to become friends with but i haven't been able to get close to. I have no idea how to become close to people and make friends and I am getting more and more depressed by the day. It feels like no one likes me, and I have absolutely no idea if thats the depression talking or if thats the truth and I am depressed because i finally realized that. I am so confused and I don't know what to change and what is stopping me from becoming better friends with people. I don't know if I am an unlikable person or if I am just really awkward and that is what repels people.

At 2017\\'s March my mother\\'s only brother (sibling in general) past away from heart disease and next month my father found this as distraction may i say to begin saying that my mother is a wh@re and is going to the school so the head-chef f@cks her.... its so sad guys that this guy left the work at school 3 months before that , he went to almost everyone he knew to characterize and judge my mother as a wh@re. Literally to everybody... well my mother shutted her mouth and stood back not resisting (i dont know how to describe it well) and actually let him come back to our house at approx. August , hm it went well shall i say for sometime but all of a sudden he left the house and went back to his paranoia .. he found a gypsy woman which he has relationship with now ( she is fat and ugly) , i managed to crack his facebook account and we ( me and my mom) got into his conversations with that \"lady\" and we found really smuttile stuff , there was things about v@brators and m@sturbating and really sad stuff in there .. my mother now has depression and she is so stressed (she considered suiciding actually) ... now that gypsy is controlling him and shes taking his money and she\\'s trying to seduce him away from us , she\\'s ridiculing him in public (cafes and other places).

The price of the cards are not included. \\n\\nThey got me a small notepad that looked like it came from the dollar store for my birthday, and a couple stickers for Xmas. There was no card included or even a piece of paper that had my name on it.  \\n\\nLast year they got me a $15 gift with the receipt for my birthday. My gifts were around the same value (~$15).\\n\\nI try not to place too much importance on the price tag, since it is the thought that counts, but their gift to me is really cheap (~$1-2), and looked like it was slapped together an hour before we met. I know they can afford to buy a gift.

I honestly thought it would of been better if they just didn't give me a gift at all.\\n\\nIs this a sign? Are they trying to tell me something or do they really think of me so little?

I could also brush this off as a one time thing, but I think that this is not the case. \\n\\n \", \"my parents created me and ruined me\\nmy mother got pregnant with me just before she turned 15 and has always lived in a bad environment this lead to her using drugs and misusing alcohol. my father is 4 years older then my mother so he was 19 when my mother got pregnant. none of this is a problem other then my mothers bad choices. my parents split up when I was a baby and so growing up I was fed lies about both my life became a contest of who id love the most. lots of other things happen around the time I turn 10 and I then I started to live with my father and my three half brothers where taken away. my father never really did anything to help me cope with the separation and my mother has ran away by the time I found out. for the last 5 years my mother would occasionally contact me and talk about how things will change but nothing ever did.\\n within the second year of me living with my father him and his wife decide to have a baby this happens and I get a new brother  who I am extremely attached to and love so much. This was fine until I was being neglected and cast out by my stepmother because I'm not her child and she didn't want me in the first place, she was just to desperate not to lose my father. so now that they have a baby things go her way a lot more. ( none of my family on my fathers side like my stepmother as she had a much better childhood and has become very stuck up from it ) I then stop spending as much time with them as I began to feel unwanted and my father has now become a very angry and belittling man who is uninterested in anything other than his laptop and phone. they began punishing me harshly for small things and neglecting my needs for example feeding me. because I had to earn my money to buy my own food if I didn't do everything they asked they wouldn't give me the money I needed to eat. so when I was 14 I started to lose weight as i had recently  met a boy that I liked and we would go for walks  and the obvious reason was that I couldn't afford to eat everyday but I did as my grandmother was secretly feeding me and giving me everything I needed and wanted as she noticed that I wasn't getting it. because my father and his wife are both very large people and visibly overweight they became angry that I was losing weight. they would regularly humiliate me in front of my relatives saying that I'm starving myself ( I wasn't I just really liked my now boyfriend and he enjoys walking)  the older I got the worse it become until it got to  my 16th birthday where it had gotten to the point they had gotten me my provisional driving licence and the cbt lesson so I can get a moped. this may seem nice but up until this point my birthday was just a garneted meal for me. they had also told my family to only give me money which they have taken and refused to give back no this day. their motive for doing this for me was so I had transport to the job they where forcing me to get so I had to start paying rent for my room.(my room is the place where things my father has that she doesn't like goes. this wasn't a problem to me as my father spends more money than he has on some really cool stuff) also useful information they claim money for me and have never told me this so they would also make me earn everything that I had and most of the things I had I paid for myself with the money I earned by doing everything they didn't want to do like pick my brother up from his school when he started going to the school playgroup. the only thing I didn't pay for was my phone.  when I was 15 I became qualified to look after children so they decided to misuse this and make me look after my brother more than I would have liked coz it took time away from my social life and school work. they would promise to pay for my time but they never did and in fear I would be punished and made to do more work without pay I didn't say anything. \\non the day of my cbt my stepmother dropped me there and then left to go see her family for the rest of the day. this is fine but I unfortunately couldn't do the practical text which was driving on the road so they sent me home early. I was stranded in a town that was very far  from the town I live in and had nobody to come get me. but luckily I found my friend shopping in the town with her brother and I went home with them. while on the way home I had text my stepmother explaining I wasn't ready to do the practical test, as it was too dangerous because I couldn't control the bike well enough to drive on a road safely. a few minuets later my father begins texting me angrily saying that ive wasted their money and to get a job ad pay for everything myself because I had apparently refused to get on the bike and just left the lesson. because of this I got home and packed a bag and went to my mothers parents house to stay and I had no intention of ever going back to live with my father and still don't as it has been 5 months since I left.\\nwhen I first left I stayed at my mothers parents house which was two towns away from where my father lives. that only lasted for a night though and in that space of time he had come there to see me and bring me my phone as I had left it ( he had a tracking devise on it so he always new where I was) and has started texting me on my Facebook saying that I am just like my mother and lots of other horrible things like I'm on drugs and pregnant and that I'm a slut and he also said he was going to get my boyfriend arrested. within a week I lived in the same town as my father as I still have to attend school but I am still refusing to go back I now live with my grandmother ( fathers mother\\n) and occasionally live at my boyfriends house for a week or so depending how I feel . \\nwithin these last two months I have been in contact with social services as I want my things and money back and I also want contact with my brother but I don't want my father or his wife  to be present during the contact as I want nothing to do with them . \\nlast week I went there with my friends that have been helping me through the satiation of seeing my brother and his wife made him tell us to get out and them when I decided to leave she slammed the door on us at first then came out saying I'm not aloud to see him again. during this time I have found out that my father has lied to me about things all my life for example he always told me that he didn't know how old my mother was. this was proven to be a lie as my mother now lives not to fa away from me as she just got out of prison and she and others have told me about how my father attended her 16th birthday party and by then she was pregnant . I know am extremely confused about trusting people and have developed some sort of mental illness that my doctor has ignored to help me with. I'm now experiencing depressive and hyperactive episodes and will tend to black out and forget thing that have happened during long \\namounts of time . I don't know how to handle this situation can someone please give me advice on getting help and moving on with my life.    \", 'Husbands Family\\nSo long story short my husband use to live with his older brother and his wife and kids. My husband was always there for the kids he grew really attached to them. But since we got together and then got married he saw the kids less and less. So yesterday his brotherâ\\x80\\x99s wife texted him and asked him not to forget about his niece and nephew that they really miss him and that they notice that he no longer spends time with them. She says they are sad. So it kind of made me angry because ever since we got together my husbands mom his brother and the mother of the kids have always tried to push the kids on him. One time we had them over and weâ\\x80\\x99re going to drop them off and well they got mad because we couldnâ\\x80\\x99t keep them.  They always want him to be there for them like if heâ\\x80\\x99s the father and heâ\\x80\\x99s not his just the uncle. And I donâ\\x80\\x99t like when he brings them over because itâ\\x80\\x99s like they donâ\\x80\\x99t even acknowledge I am here. The kids donâ\\x80\\x99t like me and itâ\\x80\\x99s noticeable I guess theyâ\\x80\\x99re mad because I took their uncle away. Iâ\\x80\\x99m I wrong for getting mad at this I mean we are going to have our on kids some day and I donâ\\x80\\x99t need them getting jealous or not liking my kids only because he will no longer spend time with them. ', 'Am I in a bad friendship?\\nI have this friend and he\\'s actually really fun and quite an extrovert. He\\'s cheerful most of the time. But the thing is he has anger issues and he gets pissed off at people and stuff easily including me. Whenever i play games like league of legends with him he gets so mad at me for stuff that i didn\\'t even do and even at one point filed a complaint and wrote stuff that was completely false about me. And I used to ask him questions sometimes via text and he\\'d always respond but then he\\'d say \"you could\\'ve at least said hi\". So one time i just said a simple hi to him and you know what? he said \"I\\'m really not in the mood for a pointless hi\" and he seemed really moody to me especially for some reason and then he typed something \"you know i really dont know why you bother...\" i couldnt read the rest because he deleted it. But whats weird is he still wants to play league with me and stuff which i find stupid because i know hes just gonna get angry at me again and only me. he never gets angry at anyone else he plays with in that game and it makes me feel sick. So i just stopped messaging him in general. and one time he said \"you know i dont know why im so aggressive to you so lets just forget that happened\" and i didnt say much and he said \"i know you dont have much to say and i dont care so lets just forget\". He didnt even say sorry for being so mean to me. To me it just looked like someone that was trying to clean up the pile of junk he left so he doesnt need to think of it later. It makes me feel so sick to think of. And sometimes he calls me a bitch and a hoe. Like really? Why would you call your friend that? I never called him anything like that. One time he was trying to talk to me and a bunch of other people were talking over him so I couldn\\'t hear him. Then he said \"yo bitch\". I really wanted to punch him in the face that was really hurtful like I have a name cant you at least say my dam name? Sometimes I just hate him so much and its sad because hes a fun person but he just gets stupidly pissed off and says whatever he wants without thinking how hurtful or rude it is.', 'I know I\\'m overreacting but I need to vent\\nSo there is this girl I\\'ve been friends with for three years. Right now she is almost done with college but I still have to take some courses so we don\\'t see each other that often. That\\'s why she told me two weeks ago we should meet up. I told her to pick out the day which suit her best. She said Monday and I agreed. Turns out my mum needed money so I have almost nothing on me and because of that I told her I could hang out but couldn\\'t go to the restaurant she said we should try. She replied that she \"couldn\\'t make it tomorrow\" (today) and I thought wth?! you said Monday? It was you the one who said Monday not me... Anyway she said let\\'s meet up on Wednesday and I said ok but tbh I don\\'t feel like going out whatsoever. She was sorry because, and I quote, \"I thought we were going to meet today\" and I\\'m like dafuq. She, all of a sudden, forgot about it?! Does it make any sense? I guess she made plans with other people or whatever but fuck it, don\\'t say one thing and then act like you didn\\'t even say anything. I know I\\'m overreacting here but I\\'m so fucking tired of people and their \"you\\'re my best friend\" and \"I love you, I care about you\" shit. The thing is I guess I\\'m pretty pissed off because I\\'ve always struggled to make friends but even when I have they don\\'t give a shit. I\\'m so tired. Honestly, fuck everyone. ', \"How to drift away from a 'best friend' you don't like anymore?\\nI have a friend, and I am trying to put distance between us. They're generally a nice person (but do some mean things occasionally), but they're quite... boring. Okay, very boring. I don't even know how I have been able to put up with the lack of interesting conversation for the past 2 years. I need a best friend with whom I can laugh about fun stuff and not just talk about SCHOOL. \\n\\nLet's call them B. \\n\\nB has clung to me for the past 2 years, so they don't have any other friends. I have loads of other friends, but they all assume that I'm best friends with B, so they don't make an effort to include me in their friendship group. I've told quite a few of them, and they are giving me some advice on what to do, but I want to see what all of you say. \\n\\nFor the past few weeks, I have been making it quite clear that I don't really want to talk to B. I give them short answers as replies, don't make eye contact or initiate conversations and I have generally been ignoring them. I know it sounds mean, but I've had enough. I can't deal with clingy people. However, B is either EXTREMELY OBLIVIOUS, or they are just being really stubborn. \\n\\nAlso, even though I am ignoring B, I sit next to them in lots of lessons, and I also hang out in the same room as them at break and lunch so they always come and shuffle next to me! SO. INFURIATING. I don't want to change rooms, because then I won't be with my friends. \\n\\nAnother thing is that if I ignore B, I actually look like a loner. I ignore them by being antisocial in the corner doing my homework most of the time. I mean, everyone in my school already thinks I'm sort of weird child that studies all of the time, because I always seem to be studying at school (which is actually because I don't do anything at home). I also have to eat by myself at lunch, and having social anxiety definitely doesn't help with that. I know I shouldn't care about that, but it's hard not to. \\n\\nI went off on a tangent there, didn't I?\\n\\nSo basically, what I'm trying to ask you is that should I completely completely ignore B (e.g. don't talk to them at all) or is that too mean? (Please don't suggest anything that says to try and be friends with them, because I don't want to do that. I want to make exciting friendships that I will remember, and not be stuck with... a boring person. Also, I'm 14. I don't know if that will help, but meh.)\\n\\nB has turned into one of those people that... you just want to punch in the face for no reason. Do you sort of get what I mean?\\n\\nAnyway, thanks for listening to this ranty thing.

Should I remove them from my life?\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m a teenager and I have a online friend that had been making me uncomfortable lately. She asked me to call her at about 12am because she was afraid of the thunderstorm she heard and when we got on the phone she started flirting with me. I passed it off as playfulness as she has a boyfriend but she continued. She started moaning my name over and over and exposed one of her breasts. When I asked her why she said it was â\\x80\\x98cute how I reacted and funnyâ\\x80\\x99. I have no interest in her at all and I expressed this; she apologised over text but Iâ\\x80\\x99m still very uncomfortable talking to her. What should I do? ', 'Thoughts on multi-family and multi-generational households and family disagreements\\nBasically, I married into a Filipino family, and my MIL owns a fairly large chunk of farmland. She routinely expresses a desire for \"all of us\" (myself, my wife, our two kids, my sister-in-law and her husband, my brother-in-law, his wife, and his kid) to build a large house with a large living area. Each of us (read: each family) would get our own rooms, everyone would live together, and we\\'d all be one big happy family.\\n\\nExcept, not. I have a number of reasons for saying \"absolutely not\". Maybe it\\'s my POV as someone that was raised in America, but I value independence and privacy. I want my own life, and my wife feels the same. Having family involved in everything you do, always having your kids being compared to other kids in the family, and always being treated like a child just sounds like hell. Not having the freedom to have sex or even choose what to have for dinner sounds like hell. No thanks.\\n\\nIt\\'s be really easy if her MIL wasn\\'t a good person, but she is probably the most kindhearted person I\\'ve ever met. She\\'s always there to help us out, financially or if we need anything else. We\\'re there for her the best we can, too, of course. So it feels really bad to turn it down, especially since I understand enough about her culture to know that this would feel like a slap in the face. And there\\'s the financial aspect, since the land is already family-owned. Acting disinterested doesn\\'t work. \\n\\nAnyone else have family that has tried this?', 'Iâ\\x80\\x99m afraid of my family falling apart after my grandfather passes away\\nI need advice. My mother passed away from cancer 4 years ago now. I have two brothers in their 20s. One hasnâ\\x80\\x99t finished his associates and the other in nursing school but takes every chance he can get to get away from helping the family. My father is an irresponsible alcoholic who thinks itâ\\x80\\x99s beneath him to wash even his own dishes.\\n\\nI currently live in San Francisco and trying to get into medical school and making up for my precious failures in college.\\n\\nMy grandfather is the patriarch of the family. He always has been and has been the glue to keeping it together. Iâ\\x80\\x99m worried that if my grandfather passes away that my father will go deeper into alcoholism and my little brother will be his forever caretaker. \\n\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m so scared. Iâ\\x80\\x99m the only female in my family left and I feel so overwhelmed and burdened. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what to do. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know where to go. I donâ\\x80\\x99t even know how to help myself. \\n\\nThere have been days when Iâ\\x80\\x99ve come and my father has passed out on the couch and hasnâ\\x80\\x99t eaten. I just feel like I come from a trashy family and thereâ\\x80\\x99s no way out. ', 'Mom treats me like a stray cat and siblings like gold\\nMy younger brother and sister are 10/11 years younger than I am. We have an older brother but he no longer speaks to our mother and has t for about 5 years. Iâ\\x80\\x99m an adult now and I fully support myself and have since I was 18. As soon as I graduated high school and child support stopped, I was tossed out of my moms with nothing but garbage bags filled with my clothes. I was told I had to live with father even tho my mother had just bought a house with her husband and my youngest siblings. My stepfather never like me and always kept me separate from their family. They would go to dinner every Friday night and I had to stay home bc he would flip out and many other mean things. To my step dad, I was a stray cat who didnâ\\x80\\x99t belong near his children. My mother never stuck up for me and stayed with him until I was in my mid 20s when he cheated on her and left her. I was raised dysfunctional but bc of that I long for a close, supportive family. Once he was out of the picture, I was able to create relationships with my sister and brother. My siblings are now in their late teens and Iâ\\x80\\x99m 26. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve struggled immensely on my own I had no choice. I could have 3 dollars to my name and my mother wiuld take it from me for coffee etc. if she picked anything up for me I had to give her the money ASAP. Soon as child support stopped, legit the day I graduated i had to live with my dad and mother gave me only garbage bags with clothes.  good. Anything that had been mine was now my sisters (bedroom set, jewelry stand, American girl dolls list goes on. Now years later, my mother makes sure my brother and sister have everything and anything the very best of. Designer everything, newest clothes shoes, technology. When it comes to me, my mother doesnâ\\x80\\x99t do anything at all. If she buys the coffee I am to give her to $2 but reversed she would die if I asked for the money back for he coffee. Now foremost, Iâ\\x80\\x99m fully aware I am an adult and can support myself. It has nothing to do with what my mother does for siblings itâ\\x80\\x99s how she treats me compared to her treatment of siblings. For instance, I asked to use sisters perfumes that smelled good and was told no itâ\\x80\\x99s her expensive kind. Iâ\\x80\\x99m not to use anything of my brother or sisters actually. My brother s d sister themselves do not care about this stuff itâ\\x80\\x99s just my mom. When cleaning my face, my younger brother is allowed to use my sisters face cream or anything really bc well they are siblings. But i am not allowed to use the very same thing. If my mother is getting rid of things she will charge me full price. If she orders pizza and I eat a couple pieces I have to pay her half the money. Point Iâ\\x80\\x99m getting at is that she treats me like im not good enough to use my sister expensive designer perfume or face wash etc. she can buy the best of the best for them but charges me if I need anything. Holidays she spends thousands on them and if she does anything for me she only gives me gift she receives for free for spending so much as PINK etc .im not expecting to be equal. Again Iâ\\x80\\x99m an adult and can buy myself things but she canâ\\x80\\x99t spend even $25 on a gas card or something lol I should add that it is expected of me to get her and siblings expensive gifts for their bdays and Xmas. Moms bday is in January if I happen to be broke and can only afford a $25 dunkin card, my bday in February she will get me something small or a $5 dunkin card. If I canâ\\x80\\x99t afford a gift, she makes damn sure my bday co es and goes without her buying bday gift. Immature or not Iâ\\x80\\x99m very hurt by this. I was always a good kid, never in trouble, finished high school, went to some college and never asked for hand outs. Why am I not worth two small sprays of designer perfume?? ', 'I hate my mum\\nI dislike my mum. In fact, Iâ\\x80\\x99m disgusted with her and feel rage sometimes. She acts fake towards me, meanwhile behind my back, she complains and gossips about me. She hates when I talk to my dad at all because she thinks weâ\\x80\\x99re rivalling against her which isnâ\\x80\\x99t true. When I confront her with things sheâ\\x80\\x99s said, she says, â\\x80\\x98I never said that. Stop pinning me down. Youâ\\x80\\x99re lying. I never lie. Iâ\\x80\\x99m perfect.â\\x80\\x99 And she is religious. This one year I asked if I could see a therapist and she refused until I told her my reasons which she was the reason mainly. Then I told her something else and then she would deliberately ignore me and get mad every time Iâ\\x80\\x99d ask again. Until like, 1 year went by and she said I have to have a therapist who is the same religion which Iâ\\x80\\x99m not even. She went psycho this one year and yelled, slapped my older sister, threw plates at all of us until weâ\\x80\\x99d run outside to our backyard. And Iâ\\x80\\x99ve tried being honest with her. I told her I had some serious trouble at school with bullying and she knew who it was and said to me, â\\x80\\x98theyâ\\x80\\x99re always nice to me. I donâ\\x80\\x99t believe you.â\\x80\\x99 And she never talks with me about how Iâ\\x80\\x99m doing or even made dinner when I was younger so Iâ\\x80\\x99m still underweight. And she gets mad at every honest thing I say because Iâ\\x80\\x99m just kinda frank. My oldest sister has rebelled against her and stuff but yet, she still is a heartless person. And when Iâ\\x80\\x99m away from â\\x80\\x98homeâ\\x80\\x99 she wonâ\\x80\\x99t ever text or call me and then when I return â\\x80\\x98homeâ\\x80\\x99 sheâ\\x80\\x99ll yell at me and accuse and manipulate me. Sheâ\\x80\\x99ll say, â\\x80\\x98is it really that hard to send a text?!â\\x80\\x99 Meanwhile she never does. And she manipulated my dad and ever since I was 7, sheâ\\x80\\x99s wanted to divorce my dad and itâ\\x80\\x99s sad because my family is so split, all my dad wants is to just have dinner as a family but thatâ\\x80\\x99s too hard. And my â\\x80\\x98mumâ\\x80\\x99 blames my dad for the split of the family. I hate my mum, donâ\\x80\\x99t care about my older sister, but I like my oldest and younger sister and my dad.', 'I want to tell her, but...\\nIm the kind of girl who doesnt keep secrets from my mom.

I rejected it. I am very shy and anxious around people and she knew it. They were both boys, one of them being her old love interest and one of them... well. My future love interest, the man I thought my future. I\\'ve never been in a relationship, like I\\'ve said my depression and anxiety made me believe that I am not worth it and nobody is going to love me. So she asked that he wants to meet with me and how he can do that etc. I wanted to give my number to him, I told her that I would love to talk with him because she told me a lot about him. A basketball player -my favorite sports-, goes to San Francisco State University, loves motorcycles -like me- and wears all black -like me- and has blue eyes, dark hair etc. She told me that he doesn\\'t use any social media, even his phone because he hated them as a kid too. I was like okay it\\'s a oersonal preference. Like, at this point I wasn\\'t serious. Because I didn\\'t think he would like me. So I said let\\'s try to talk with him because someone like him wouldn\\'t like me anyway. \\n\\nOn my 19th birthday I got an e-mail. \\nIt was from him. \\n\\nHe was telling me happy birthday, how he wanted to write me and meet me. I was stupid, I flew with his message and we started talking. It was so beautiful. He was so sweet and kind. He was everything I wanted. Times go by, we decide to try \"us\" in a relationship. Mind you, until then I haven\\'t seen him once, even though I asked to see his face. Not because I only care about physical stuff, because it was too good to be true. My mind, my mind wasn\\'t accepting the fact that someone like him would like me. \\n\\nWe started dating, talking each other 24/7 but without any Skype or calling. I haven\\'t heard his voice once. One year passed, I totally fell in love, he told me he was in love and because of his family problems he couldn\\'t open himself. \\n\\nFew things ruined me after our magical but almost \"it\\'s nothing but a dream\" year. \\nFirst he lied to me about visiting me 3 times. He told me that he gor the ticket and he was on the way to the airport. He never came. \\nSecond time I cried my heart out because of an accident. We were talking with my \"bestie\" the girl who met us, and she send me a conversation quotes. Her argument with one of her friends. When he sent an e-mail... The exact conversation she sent me was on the bottom of his mail. We used to send tons of hearts with each mail, I guess she forgot copying the hearts again. And sent me the conversation. \\nThird time he decided to talk on Kik. You know after almost 1.5 years I wanted to speak normally, not with e-mails. I was so happy, I forgot everything he did to me, especially the mental abuse and fights about my male friends,  I said yes  open yourself to me, let me be with you etc. I was happy. A message came to me from an account with his initials. However without me having a chance to look at the message a notification about my bestie appeared on my phone, let\\'s name her \"Aurora\" about opening a Kik account with his initials. I asked her what the fuck was going on and she told me it was a joke. \\nHe never send a message from Kik. \\n\\nOver time, my mental position got worse and worse. I\\'d hurt myself regularly, I\\'d cry at nights and I\\'d walk around without any emotions. \\nOur friendship whit my \"bestie\" did end before me and he ended. When she got a new phone, her e-mail app gave an error. Until she fixed it he didn\\'t mail me even once. Fourteen days. When her phone got fixed, he started writing me immediately. \\n\\nI knew it was her. I knew it was her from the beginning but I was too hopeful to believe that someone would love me. Now I\\'m here, with tons Ä±f new friends, friends I\\'ve made after her i, because her rude actions and poisonous words left us alone in the class. However I cannot deal with it. I still hope that he was real. I cannot stand the idea about a HUMAN BEING can do such a thing to a person she called as friend. I cannot deal with it. I would love to have some advice. It\\'s been 2 weeks since my second semester has started but I cannot go to school because she will be there. And I am afraid I may hurt myself or worse, I may hurt her at some point. ', 'i have no respect for my father and im happy for him to die.\\nmy dad has been an awful person my whole life (so far im 12) , when i was as young 8 he told me i have to study and go to university and if i dont im a failure to my family and he has spread rumours (all of which are false), tried to make me move in with him by saying my mum will kill me and that if i move in with him i can go to a private school + saying the current school im in is awful and 1 out of 100 kids will go to uni there even though 65 percent of people there get bachelors. and finally he has this thing to treat me like a baby and im sick of it, and earlier today i was making a glass of water and he said to me like i was 3 what are you drinking mr ryhan (my name is ryhan) i told him its just water cant you see it and that triggers fucking stupidity meltdown. i hate my dad i honestly dont care if he dies and i hope someone poisons him so he can get the bullet to the fucking head he deserves.', 'Is it bad that I am kind of mad my friend never follows my advice?\\nThe friend in question and I have been friends for over 7 years and best friends for the last 3 years and have shared just about every detail of our life. I am a very observant person and have seen many repetitions in her behavior over the last years. \\nThe heading is a bit misleading here. I am not mad at her that she doesnâ\\x80\\x99t follow my advice. Rather, I am somewhat annoyed that she keeps making the same mistakes with the same toxic people in her life. I have been telling her that many of the people she surrounds herself with are very manipulative and are using her in one way of another as she has actually realized that, however she canâ\\x80\\x99t seem to actually do anything about this and keeps sacrificing her own needs to satisfy those of the people around her. This doesnâ\\x80\\x99t just happen once or twice, but it happens almost on a daily basis and I can basically feel her mental stability deteriorating. I have been telling her for forever that she should focus on her personal growth and leave the toxic people in her life behind. I know that that is super hard to do and super easy to says and that you canâ\\x80\\x99t follow that super easily and I have been trying very hard to be as supportive as I can and listen to her and be a shoulder to cry on. But itâ\\x80\\x99s also very hard to see her being hurt over and over again by the same type of people or even the same person when there is a solution to the problem. And it seems like she isnâ\\x80\\x99t learning and instead she is just getting more and more insecure and anxious and her panic attacks are increasing in frequency because of these people. And it also makes me very anxious when I constantly worry about her. But I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to guilt or manipulate her into any decisions. And I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what to do. help pls im desperate. ', 'Might have gotten my friend fired at work\\nFirst of all: hello! \\n\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m just gonna jump right in. So I (23/f) have been best friends with this girl (letâ\\x80\\x99s call her maya) for about 3 1/2 Years now. Another girl (we will go with Ashley) became part of our group about a year later and maya asked us to start working at the restaurant she served at part time. \\nEventually, maya started a thing with this guy who was in a relationship at the time, so we obviously didnâ\\x80\\x99t really put a lot of hope into the whole thing. But eventually he broke up with the other girl to be with maya. Now she started really getting into weed (like 3 blunts a day all by herself) and then dropping pills on the weekends. Ashley and I are not into it so we stayed away but tried to still hang out but it got more and more difficult being with her because she either a) fell asleep b) throw up all the time c) was just super uncomfortable to be around. \\nAlso work got fucking disastrous because she asked us to pick her up and every single time she either overslept or just forgot about it... so we were always late with her. \\nLast week it really excalated: she left Ashley hanging for over an hour, didnâ\\x80\\x99t pick up her phone, I cancelled all my plans to go to work instead of maya and or coworker was all by himself with a huge group of guests. And all she did was send us a voice mail telling us what we should tell our boss. (Not even a reason why all of it happened)\\nObviously, we were both really pissed and I just told our superior what had happened and why I was there instead of her. Needless to say he was mad and said that our boss has to talk to her about this because it obviously just a big no go. \\nThe issue is, she kind of expected us to lie for her and I donâ\\x80\\x99t think I can deal with that anymore. She has become so enstranged lately and I donâ\\x80\\x99t want to support her selfish and self-destructive behaviour. But now I guess I might have made her lose her job and i donâ\\x80\\x99t know if I should apologise and try to talk our boss into letting her stay or just accept that sheâ\\x80\\x99ll hate me forever and go on with my life. \\nIâ\\x80\\x99ve told her that I donâ\\x80\\x99t like the whole drug thing but she laughed it off, called me a coward and sheltered. But she also treats me (and Ashley to an extend) like her servants and all my other friends canâ\\x80\\x99t stand to be around her. \\nSo really, i donâ\\x80\\x99t know how to approach her with the whole situation because in the end Iâ\\x80\\x99m going to be the horrible friend that ruined her life. Should I apologise or/and try to damage control the whole thing at work? \\n\\nTLDR: friend has drug problem and left all of us hanging at work again so i didnâ\\x80\\x99t play along with the hundredth shitty excuse She wanted us to tell ', 'Sexual Harassment Problem on me\\nMe and my friend are together for like 5 years and after graduation he choose to work with me at the same company.

All of them tend to gossip about me. I am the odd ball, the one who doesn\\'t agree with them. The one they all tend to chat about. Many times we have arguments, they all gain up on me. I will have my mom, dad, and older sisters all attacking my character- telling me I am no good and that I am poison . I have caught them in a few instances; but they brush it off. Often, they pretend I am being paranoid or they play dumb and be like, \"I did nothing, we said nothing.\" Sometimes they complain about someone else to use it to get to me. It\\'s really bothersome. It makes me feel so betrayed, confused, and really angered. I also not my family learns things about me before I even told them- mainly negative. There are lists of inconsistent gaps. I try to confront them but they immediately dismiss me. They try to cover up their tracks and always tell me I am paranoid. I know lots of the advice will be to confront them, but I do not believe that will work. I have tried that- all kinds of approaches but they insist they did nothing even when I catch them saying things about me. My mother does it the most. Often she, gossips after work with my sisters or sometimes with my dad. Sometimes my sisters gossip about me together. I have become the play thing in the family- my problems and life is just a giant joke they can share their contempt for. It\\'s hurts. It\\'s hard not to give a shot because it\\'s your own family. I have considered audio recording secretly but that is creepy and invades their privacy despite they do that with me often. It\\'s also wrong to play the same game. What should I do? I really am at a loss. ', \"Why is my dad like this\\nMy brother was recently tripped in the cafeteria as a joke. It was another friend and they do it to eachother all the time, but my brother ended chipping his front tooth.\\n\\nThe two of us go to a joint middle/high school and I really appreciated all my guy friends who went up to talk to him and ask if he was ok. \\n\\nToday these two guys ask me when he's going to get it fixed when I have to admit to them my dad doesn't want to take him to the dentist but rather just get him a grill. They laughed so hard. \\n\\n(This just seemed like a fun story to tell I didn't expect y'all to take this so seriously.

I just assumed it was just life getting in the way, but recently my dad tried to contact this cousin about some money he loaned him to buy my old car (which I sold to him well under half of market value), because my dad needed the money to pay for a surgery (he has stage 4 liver cirrhosis). My cousin never replied and money aside I can tell this really hurt my dad (he's bottling it, but I can tell) considering this is my Dad's favorite nephew. I feel like this is my cousin throwing a bit of a tantrum over having to be an adult (he just barely turned 19) and I texted him to call me when got off work to explain how serious my fathers illness is (our grandma died of the same condition) and how he shouldn't cut off his uncle who has done a lot for him, but it's been 3days already. My main motivation for this is that I know stage 4 cirrhosis can move to end stage very suddenly and I want my dad to have as few regrets and worries during what may be God forbid his last few years. I just wanted to talk about this. Advice is very welcome and before anyone suggests he doesn't have the money, he does, he just sold the car we sold him for above market value and has a very good paying job as a mechanic at a car dealership.\", 'I don\\'t know if I am allowed to feel this way\\nI don\\'t have many friends to start with. I mean I do, but when I count close friends, I nearly have none as I am slowly starting to lose them. I have great friends, amazing friends that were always there for me in the past, but I just don\\'t feel any of that anymore. And yes, I know I should be considerate that they are people that have a life of their own with school and family and all their homework, but I feel in a way neglect. I asked them for once if they wanted to hang out, but they reply with \"sorry I\\'m busy with homework\" but then I see that they were making a costume and having a photoshoot with some other friend which would have took hours of work. I know I shouldn\\'t say anything and I should be forunate that they still consider me their prized friend however, I feel neglected. I feel as if they don\\'t even care or want to even care about me anymore because I\\'m the one always chatting in the chat, but I get short replies back once in the blue moon. It makes me feel like they just stopped because they found someone else. \\n\\nOn top of that, they calmed they were sick and I do believe that. They actually had initially told me that they wanted to give me a present for Christmas which is rare because they never really give me things (once on a blue moon maybe) and I only give gifts to them for their birthday. But now since they are sick, I have a feeling I\\'m going to be told \"no, sorry I am sick and need to relax after finals\" when they always go out with their other friends for these occasions no matter what. I want to say this again, but I feel that it is not right that I am feeling disappointed and neglected because a person is allowed to do what they want. I am not not allowed to tell them what to do as they have their own life and I wouldn\\'t like that. But please, my request is may I have some advice about or further insight about what you guys could possibly be seeing in this situation? My point of view I feel is too biased because I already know the person and their habits and I have an emotional response to this.

I thought wow ok didn\\'t expect it from friends but I guess some people are petty about some things. And they knew that it got to me a little that they didn\\'t tell me but whatever. Now they would bring up the topic of this \"item\" here and there knowing how they treated me regarding it. I have strong suspicions they are doing it to spite me or prod me to give a reaction or just to reinforce their \"dominant\" position. They probably get a kick out of it. The problem is, I don\\'t know the best way to react to it when it\\'s brought up in convo to show that I\\'m not envious or jealous. And I\\'m not jealous of it at all as I actually found out what I needed to through other means, it just bugs me that they think it does and so I don\\'t want to give off that vibe so they can go into a private convo and laugh about it.', 'Advice Please\\nI\\'ve been in a relationship with a woman for some time now, and it\\'s becoming serious enough that marriage is a certainty. She has a son from her previous marriage, seven years old. Her previous husband, however, was very controlling and abusive. Her son has a lot of behaviour issues as a result. He constantly swears (\"fuck, shit, cunt, etc\", just to show how extreme), he\\'s violent a lot, throwing things across the room, he\\'s constantly screaming and shouting, no concept of manners. He\\'ll shout \"give me food now\". His mother, as a result of the cruel treatment she got from her husband, is too scared to stand up to him. He clearly has anger issues bordering on clinical. He\\'ll often have breakdowns with fits of anger.\\n\\nShe lives with her parents. While they have the best of intentions for their grandson, her mothers treatment of her is vile. She\\'s cruel and demeaning. She constantly undermines her confidence and authority, saying she\\'s stupid and doesn\\'t know what she\\'s doing in front of her son, and then, stupidly, complains that she get her son to listen to her. She regularly swears. She loudly gossips about everybody, complaining about with violent undertones. And to make it worse, she often threatens calling social services on her. Personally, I doubt she would, as she got far more incriminating evidence against her than her daughter. But either way, he would be taken from both of them.\\n\\nSo, yeah..... a bit complicated. No idea what to do. As it\\'s very likely that I\\'ll become a step father to this child, I was wondering what advice people could give, or direct me to somewhere that could help. Thanks', 'Was this a true friendship? TL;DR (?)\\nA friend that I have know for 15 years just blocked me on facebook. I have always had feelings for her but I had began to move on. I don\\'t have a lot of friends and I always liked having her as a friend and as someone I could go to. She was willing to do this with me even when she was dating someone else. As she got more serious with the other guy she started to talk to me less and less and she started to not chat with me as much about her life but she always wanted to hear about my problems and woes.\\n\\nI really started to feel that something was wrong when she recently got married. We had talked about marriage a few times in previous years. She had indicated that she was unsure if she would ever get married then she said she was considering it with her bf. Then one day she moved to a the same city as her husband to be but when I asked her about why or if she was considering marrying him she said she moved because she liked it there more. She hid the fact that she was engaged from me but still allowed a friendship. I know that it shouldn\\'t have mattered that she was getting married but I did want to be supportive of it and I also wanted to know because I felt that it would be unappropriate for us to be the same type of friends that we were. One day I called her to tell her some really bad news about something that had happened in my life. I called several times but she didn\\'t answer because she was busy. She finally returned my call at midnight and got onto me for calling her so much and then said \"I can\\'t do this\". Then she put severe restrictions on it saying that  I could only talk to her in sever circumstances or to tell her things but she would never initiate contact with me or make small talk with me. I got fed up and told her that it wasn\\'t true friendship if she wouldn\\'t reciprocate communication or tell me about major things in her life getting married. I also brought up some things from the past that made me feel the way that I feel towards her. Then she blocked me on facebook and told me that she wanted to discontinue all communication altogether.\\n\\n I feel like she knew that she had be wrong with me in the past but refused to admit it to me. Was this ever a true friendship? Am I wrong for feeling like my heart was torn out because of what she did? Is what she did OK from her end? Was she wrong or could she have been better about communicating this with me? I just don\\'t know how to process what happened and I feel bad but I still feel that if I am going to call somebody a friend, I should be able to talk to them about life without limitation. I do know there are boundaries but just making small talk shouldn\\'t violate a boundary. I am just looking for validation.\\n\\nI still do care about her as a person.

I believe my younger brother is way cooler than me. I've never been one of the most popular people in any given situation, but I have a few close friends so it's not too bad. My brother however is one of those people that can walk into a room and immediately own it. Where my clothing style is a bit uninteresting, his is eye-catching. While I'm fairly quiet and not particularily funny, he is confident and charismatic. I get invited to parties every now and then, but he gets invited to parties every week. Oh and it doesn't help that he is taller than me nowadays. \\n\\nHe is not better than me at everything thankfully. For instance I'm an organised person and my grades are far above average, while his grades are far below. The point is that I'm not a cool person by any stretch but he is very popular and respected. It's silly I know, but it does hurt my pride a bit seeing as I'm older than him, and you usually expect the older sibling to have the high ground in this respect. Am I alone in this? Anyone else who have experienced something similar? :P\", 'I\\'m having trouble getting along with someone I want to consider a friend\\nLong story short: This guy was originally a friend of a friend, I\\'ll call him Jeff. We all go to the same college and have the same mutual friends. Jeff and I got along pretty well for a bit but recently all he does is piss me off\\n\\nWhile I get the whole \"friends mess with each other\" idea, but it just doesn\\'t fly with me and this guy. I may mess around with my friends once in a while and I\\'m a big joker, but for the most part I just like to have a good time together whenever we do anything whether we play video games, go to the gym, etc.\\n\\nOn the other hand, it feels that Jeff goes out of the way to piss me off no matter what we do because he KNOWS it will piss me off. I know typically you want to show no reaction to this kind of thing to avoid fanning the flames but I can\\'t help it\\n\\nI don\\'t know how to deal with him or get the message across. When I tried to sit down with him and talk man to man, Jeff didn\\'t seem to take me seriously and kept going ahead with his previous antics. I talked with our other friends (who have known him longer than I) and they all just told me something along the lines of: \"he doesn\\'t mean anything by it, it\\'s just how he is don\\'t get offended\". But unfortunately, we don\\'t mix that way.\\n\\nNow Jeff\\'s not inherently a bad person, when he\\'s serious he\\'s actually a pretty good guy. He has helped me out in some tough binds before and has done so for the other guys too, all of which I greatly appreciate. But his behavior to me on a day to day basis just really really pisses me off', \"HELP! my friend invited herself along to a romantic holiday i was in the process of planning with my boyfriend.\\nI (19, F) flat with my boyfriend (19, M) and best friend (19, F).  Yesterday i bought up that me and my boyfriend were wanting to go to Aus at the end of the year in the summer as a treat. my friend jumped at this and was saying how much she'd love to go to aus as well, and how great it would be if we all went together. i have to admit i was kind of encouraging her, and talking about what we would do and how much fun it would be etc. but now she's looking at flights and hotels and asking me so many questions about it when actually i want this trip to be a thing that me and my boyfriend do, as a romantic holiday. i love my friend and it would be a lot of fun with her there but i also want this to be special and intimate with my boyfriend. we want to do our own things together. i feel so bad about this i don't want to end up ditching her or for her to feel like she's not wanted. how do i tell her this??? how do i make it clear that this isn't a friend group holiday, this is a romantic holiday for me and my bf.

HELP lol \", 'My little brother was in pain and I didn\\'t help him\\nI need to get something off my chest that I haven\\'t talked to anyone about before. It\\'s about a situation, where my mother freaked out over my little brother\\'s bratty behaviour. He was about 5 years old and throwing a fit, he was in a really bad moment, he kicked my leg, and all those things weren\\'t pretty. Something must have been bothering him, usually he is a very wonderful person, funny and smart, but just threw a tantrum like every kid does once in a while. When he called me a bitch (his big sister, and I might even have been teasing him) my mother totally freaked out, she scolded him loudly and he already started crying. She went outside to the car and took out his car seat and said she wouldn\\'t need it anymore now that he\\'s not part of the family anymore but will be taken away by child services.\\n\\nHe stood on the front porch and cried his heart out and screamed to my mother \"I don\\'t want to go to the welfare home\" (that\\'s what it was called to him apparently) and he sobbed so desperately and feared for his life and safety. And my mom then looked at him sternly and asked him to apologize and then they hugged and made up.\\n\\nIt is probably the most painful thing in my life. I know he might already have forgotten it and he gets along quite well with my mother (he\\'s a teenager now), but I do think back to that moment and feel that stabbing pain in my chest, as I was standing there passively and watching my mother use him emotionally. He was so fragile and vulnerable, and if I could, I would just wrap him in my arms and love and comfort him, until there\\'s no sadness left in him.', \"Only friend who consistently wants to hang out with me--I've started liking him less and less! help?\\nNo names or genders here, and I'm not getting into specifics on events just in case...\\n\\n\\nI have one friend who consistently wants to hang out, unlike my other friends, but the problem is that over the last few years I've started liking them less and less. They're fun to talk to and hang out with -usually- but their personality grates on me and there have been a few times when they have made me quite angry in ways that are difficult to reconcile. They can also end up being a downer though they have been working on it. An unknown quantity of my other friends also dislike them (I know a few for sure, but who knows how many they've pissed off in the meantime) so I either have to plan events without them (and they get upset) or not invite my other friends who dislike them.\\n\\n\\nWe've known each other for years, and they consider myself and a few others very close friends but I have gotten the distinct impression it's one-sided. But they haven't done anything wrong (to ME) that would really merit breaking up a friendship so I've kept begrudgingly hanging out with them and chatting with them even though I'd rather not and just forget they exist. At one point I was one of very, very few friends they had, but I know they have a good consistent friend group now so...\\n\\n\\nI don't know! Advice, please? Is it ok to just not want to be friends anymore even if the other person hasn't done anything wrong? When I think about hanging out with them even though I know we'd probably do something fun I just feel apprehensive and mildly annoyed.\", \"Pissed at my wife and mother in law\\nWe are new parents with an 8 month old baby.\\n\\nHere is how my wife's day looks like:\\n\\nTake care of baby, clean the dishes, do 1 laundry and cook dinner 3 times/week.\\n\\nHere is how my day looks like:\\n\\nI help around by taking care of the baby at least 2 hours/day so my wife can rest.

Because she talked about me behind my back and I had no way to defend myself. I'm so pissed off I just want to call my monster in law and give her a pile of shit about how lazy her daughter actually is and that she only knows half the story and that she had no f'ing business talking dirt about me behind my back.\", \"Was it wrong to block my dad's phone?\\nWas it wrong of me to block my dad? We had a massive fight that just escalated quickly, as we always do. My dad has a habit to threaten to disown me every time he gets angry. Once I pointed out how hurtful it was, and asked him to please not to say that, but nothing changed. So Iâ\\x80\\x99m just trying not to respond to these angry text messages about how he wanted me to stop using their address because we are not family anymore. 20 minutes later he sends another message telling me to do as he says or he will embarrass me in an extended family group chat (he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t know that it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t bother me and he eventually carries out this threat later), and then 20 minutes later he offers me a deal where he would drop this address issue if I do a couple of things that he wanted. Sorry for being vague, the things he wanted were the things I essentially didnâ\\x80\\x99t want to do and is linked to what we had an argument about. From my perspective, I saw messages that were intentionally hurtful, about how I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t family, and then I saw a threat to shame me, and then I saw what looks like a way to manipulate or coerce me into doing what he wanted. It was very late at night and I had work the next day. That was the point I blocked his number (and I told him before I blocked it) and it is the first time ever in all 30 years of my life. However, now Iâ\\x80\\x99m wondering if it was the right thing to do, because well, Asian parents always say shit like that and donâ\\x80\\x99t mean it, and I think my very drastic step would have upset both my parents a lot. An imposed silence also sabotages the opportunity for future open communication and is quite passive aggressive as well. If they were overreacting about the disowning me part, then I could have angered them to the point where they decide to go through with it.\\n\\nThe next two days I unblocked my dad and sent some messages about how I was sorry I had to block my dad and clarified some of the things they were unhappy about (some of what they were unhappy about wasn't at all true). But I think both my parents have now blocked my number. Yet I can't blame them for doing that because I did it to them first, but I do wish I had just turned off my mobile, or been able to bear the burden of hearing shitty talk, instead of blocking my dad. (It's not possible to visit them as we live in different countries).  \\n\\nPrior to this fight, I have been working through â\\x80\\x98abandonmentâ\\x80\\x99 issues with a therapist.

My parents don't know this. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve thought about completely cutting my dad out of my life, but Iâ\\x80\\x99m undecided as I feel like other people who have done it have more serious issues like abuse, violence, lying, and more about conflicts on serious issues like marriage, religion, sexual identity and child custody.\\n\\nWould really appreciate some 'Asian' perspective here, as most of my friends don't fully understand the cultural aspect of this. \\n\", 'Clingy friend\\nSo I have a friend who lives pretty far from me. Let me preface this by saying that he has expressed a romantic interest in me, but I am not interested in men, and have told him so. He helped me through a difficult time in my life, and I have thanked him many times for it. I have tried to do the same for him on multiple occasions, but it seems like the more attention I give him, the more he wants. I do not feel that we need to have hour long phone discussions and 26 text messages on a daily basis - I donâ\\x80\\x99t talk to ANYONE that much. I started ignoring a text or two here and there, hoping he would catch on. He did, apparently, and we just went about 3 weeks with no contact. \\n\\nHad he sent me a normal text today, I would have answered. Instead, he sent a passive-aggressive â\\x80\\x9cEver since youâ\\x80\\x99re feeling better, you never bother to call me.â\\x80\\x9d \\n\\nThis is simply NOT true. I have called him many times when he said he needed to talk, even though I hate talking on the phone. I just simply canâ\\x80\\x99t take this level of neediness. Iâ\\x80\\x99m not sure how to explain to him that constant contact drives me nuts and I need space. Every time I try to explain this to him, he seems to feel that it was designed as a personal attack against him. \\n\\nAny thoughts on this? Iâ\\x80\\x99m not going to text him back until Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had some time to think about the right thing to say.

As long as she\\'s at home with her dogs she\\'s \"happy\"\\n\\nShe is basically miserable and moody every single day. I really don\\'t understand it. She was never like this. Have any of you had this? What did you do to deal with it? It\\'s like she prefers being negative over anything. Nothing gets her excited. Nothing makes her happy? It\\'s so shit.

I have kept in touch with everyone on a weekly or bi-weekly basis on the phone this whole time, as well as every couple of days on social media. \\n\\nWe were all so close before, but since we moved, it feels like everyone just wants to forget we existed.

We jokingly call each other \"husband and wife\"!\\n\\nShe\\'s an artist by practice and (through her inheritance) has the ability to not have to work a full time job and simply practice art. She\\'s getting recognized internationally and is also just started as the creative director at a local female owned bar/art house.\\n\\nI am SUPER excited to see her doing all these things and I ALWAYS go to the openings of her events and show support when I can. I have traveled with her to art shows and helped set up her booth.\\n\\nRecently, I\\'ve had several bad dreams about her. In one dream, I was choking her and screaming in her face. In my dream last night, I was stalking her, trying to find out if she was \"cheating on me\".\\n\\nI think what I\\'m most jealous of is her freedom while I\\'m chained to a desk job all day.\\n\\nHow do I address this so that I don\\'t end up being resentful for her success! I feel like I\\'m being left behind.\\n\\nTL;DR I\\'m jealous of my successful friend and want to stop. ', \"How to cope with disrespectful and lying friend?\\nHI I'm new to reddit so please bear with me\\n\\nSo this is the situation: \\nMy friend and I often interact while playing online games as we're both huge nerds and gamers. I really enjoy spending time with her. However she has this other friend that I really dislike and I would rather play alone than put up with interacting with her friend. I have on multiple occasions expressed my discomfort with her friend and she has acknowledged it but would still invite him anyways without asking me. When that happens I usually just say sorry I don't feel like playing. Sorry for being difficult. She knows her friend will repel me. So anyways after sometime I asked if I can request not to invite him when I'm playing with her and would understand if she said no cause I realize it's a selfish request. She said it's ok no problem. So then we proceed to our routine and there's no issue whatsoever. I told her if it's too difficult to say no or your friend keeps bugging you about it I can go as I didn't want to make it difficult with my own selfishness. \\n\\nThe problem a rise when she invited a mystery friend with different name. I suspected and knew that it was her friend that I disliked so immediately asked who that was and she said it's just a random. Not happy with her lying I went off to calm down and confronted her about it, trying to be as clear and straight to the point as I can. I expressed that what she did was hurtful and disrespectful in my point of view. I told her I'm not pleased at the fact she lied even when I called her out. So I said it's on her to resolve this issue. She replied saying there is no issue and what she did was fine. Saying it wasn't disrespectful and its not a big lie plus it was to see if I would even notice its her friend. Long story short she said if it was her she wouldn't be angry cause she's a grown up and that I'm being immature and childish by blowing things out of proportion over such joke-trivial matter. \\n\\nSo this is more or less the situation and at the moment it's not good. As she thinks I'm in the wrong and she's right. I have considered the fact that I am wrong and have asked for an outside opinion but all my friends are just angry at how she's treating me. \\n\\nI understand that she can be friends with and spend time with whoever she wants. It's her life afterall. I'm not making her choose cause I know it's selfish and wrong so I'm choosing to remove myself in that situation as it's the only thing to do besides putting up with her friend. My problem is the fact that she attempted to trick me to play together with her friend and continue lying about it upon confrontation. Also by doing so I feel disrespected as she completely disregarded my feelings and opinion in the matter. I would have been perfectly fine if she told me at the start her friend wants to play and she can't really say no or she wants to play with him etc etc. In that case I'll just make myself scarce which I have no issue on doing. Instead she resorted to being deceitful with something so simple and dumb. There's quite a lot more so I'll probably update this but this is in essence more of less the situation. \", 'Possessive friends\\nHi there, this is my first post.\\nI became friends with a girl from my new class this year (who i had never met until we came into the same class) and became good friends with each other.She has a big network of friends and is quite different from me(talks to everyone, likes everyone, an extrovert). One day, a boy who happens to be her best friend saw us talking and got angry(for the life of me, i do not know why) and started making fake rumors about me, which she blindly believed. when she came to confront me about these false allegations, i flipped out and got quite angry and i have not talked to her for 3 days.\\nHer friends are determined to hate me for some unknown reason and at the same time the girl has to problem with this, even defending them, saying that they are just very possessive of her.\\nI am in a dilemma on what to do, ignore the hate or to stop caring and ignore her.', 'Are my friends leaving me out on purpose?\\nThis has been bugging me for a while, I mean I\\'ve gotten to the point where I\\'ve made a Reddit account to vent about it. So I\\'m on of those girls who has two best friends, I\\'m sure you can already see where this is headed (I\\'ll call them Susie and Amy). \\n\\nWhen I started secondary school I didn\\'t have any friends since I had joined out with my school catchment area. Although, I met Susie and she quickly became my best friend. We were in a big group of girls which included Amy. Amy and Susie had become close since they lived near each other and had had lots of sleepovers and days out together and stuff. I had made friends with a girl called Ruby who was Amy\\'s best friend at the time and eventually Amy and Ruby fell out, causing the group to split up and because I was closer to Susie, I went with her. \\n\\nThis left Amy, Susie, and I to form a little \"squad\" and the three of us were extremely close for the next three years. Some things happened with Susie which resulted in Amy and I falling out with her for about 10 months. Nothing big, just usual girly bitching and drama. Amy and I became extremely close during this time but something Amy told me really hurt. \\n\\nWhen we were in the process of making up with Susie, Susie had told Amy that she considered Amy to be the closest person to her. That couldn\\'t be right? I went to Susie\\'s house every Friday? I helped her out with her chores whenever I was over, I stayed over almost every weekend, I went on trips with her and her family all the time, we sat next to each other in almost every class, we constantly texted and called and she wouldn\\'t hesitate to tell me every detail of her life and problems and neither would I. Amy had a job and was always working weekends, she was also never the type to text people or even call since she was always with her sister. So why did Susie consider her closer? It really stung but I got over it. \\n\\nMy issue now is that since the three of us have made up I can\\'t help but feel a little excluded. I\\'ll only give one example since everything\\'s of a similar nature. \\n\\nWe\\'ve been off school for the past three days because of the snow. I saw that Susie was at Amy\\'s house on the first day, I was a little bummed about not being invited but I brushed it off since it could\\'ve just been a spontaneous visit. But Susie is at Amy\\'s Mothers house today, I\\'m assuming she\\'s staying over, and it\\'s not like I live an hour away. I live a 15 minute walk away, it would only take 5 minutes to get a lift there and the snow isn\\'t bad anymore. So...did I do something to warrant not being invited? Usually Amy would always invite me over, we would have loads of sleepovers...\\n\\nAnd y\\'know to top it all off, my Grandma passed away on Tuesday, Susie had met my grandma and visited her with me a lot and even though I had told her what happened she messaged me later to ask why I seemed sad, only to act shocked and say she \\'never realised\\' that my grandma had died even though I had already told her. Amy knew my grandma had died too but she hasn\\'t said a word to cheer me up. These girls aren\\'t awkward or unsympathetic either, they\\'ve taken care of me when someone has passed away before. Are they being like this on purpose? \\n\\nTL;DR \\nClose friends I\\'ve had for years are excluding me, is it on purpose or by accident?', 'In an awkward situation with my best friend. She wants me to tell how I feel towards her - how should I?\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ve been friends with her for 3 years. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s a lovely person and I really like her, but there were some occasions where I felt weird around her. \\n\\nShe apparently sensed it and recently asked me whatâ\\x80\\x99s wrong between us, telling I should tell her if thereâ\\x80\\x99s something. \\n\\nSome of the things Iâ\\x80\\x99m thinking of telling her are:\\n\\n- she often kind of invites herself when she learns I hang out with my friends and invites other people (that I donâ\\x80\\x99t know well) as well without asking me when I organise something (picnic, trip etc.) \\n\\n- sheâ\\x80\\x99s a nice person and means well, but she sometimes says things that hurt my feelings. For example, she said she couldnâ\\x80\\x99t wait to move into a new flat with her bf or how heâ\\x80\\x99s like in bed when I was having a difficult time after a breakup, and she often assumes Iâ\\x80\\x99m broke and I feel sort of belittled. \\n\\n- she tells my rather personal stuff to her other friends, like gossip\\n\\nI could list several things, but Iâ\\x80\\x99m not sure if I should be upfront, as she has social anxieties and I donâ\\x80\\x99t want her to feel bad or scared in social situations. Or are there nicer ways to put them? \\n\\nAlso, I should probably mention that I have a small circle of friends, and sheâ\\x80\\x99s basically been my only friend that I get to see regularly, Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been really good friends with a girl (B) that I met partly through her for the past few months.

I\\'ve brought up his absence and asked him what\\'s going on, and his answer is usually the standard runaround, \"oh nothing\", \"i\\'ve just been avoiding everyone\", \"just doing my own thing\".

I could sense his desire not to talk about it (which he never does, he hates discussing anything feelings related), so i let it go.\\n\\nNext time we spoke, i brought it up again, asked him how he was doing with his issues, and got the usual \"meh\" or \"i dunno\".  When i asked what i could do to help him, he answered, \"you can stop fucking asking me about it\", so i of course let it go, and our convo continued as if there were no problems.  But of course there are, he\\'s still MIA for weeks at a time.  The thing is, this is a pattern with him.  We\\'re normal buddies, seeing/chatting all the time for months, and then WHAM, he\\'s out and like this for weeks or a few months.  Then as if another switch goes off, he\\'s back on again and acts normal and as if nothing\\'s happened.  This has happened more times than i can count.\\n\\nYou know i wouldn\\'t be so concerned if he were actually busy with life and doing things, but as he tells it in his own words when i do see him, he\\'s doing nothing out of the ordinary (which for him is work and sitting home every night by himself (lives alone) playing video games (something we usually do together).  But as far as i can tell he\\'s just sitting alone by himself every night.  \\n\\nI\\'ve considered the possibility he\\'s depressed or bi-polar (although you\\'d never get him to admit that), in which case i don\\'t know what to do if he won\\'t talk to me about it.  I\\'ve considered that perhaps i\\'ve done something to make him angry, but when he does come around (if i\\'m not bringing up this issue), he acts completely normal and we laugh and cut up, and whatnot like nothings wrong.  I\\'ve thought perhaps he\\'s just not interested in being friends anymore, but he does still come around, and as i\\'ve said, after one of these episodes for a few weeks/months it\\'s as if nothing\\'s happened at all.  \\n\\nSo my problem is this.  I don\\'t know what to do when he\\'s like this.  I don\\'t know how to act, what to say, how to approach him, etc.  You know, he\\'s my best friend, i\\'d like to be there for him, to help if i can, but he rebuffs any attempt on my part to find out what\\'s really going on, well besides him just \"avoiding everyone right now, and doing my own thing\".  He gets agitated if i push the issue.  So how do i handle this?  Is there a way to broach this topic that would get a better response?  When he does come around, how should i act around him?  What do i say, should i even bring it up?  I\\'m a very open person regarding my feelings and inner workings, and he\\'s obviously not.  If this is just a thing he does, if it\\'s not my fault and there\\'s genuinely nothing i can do to help, how would i even get him to tell me that\\'s the case if he doesn\\'t like talking about it?  When he gets this way i just feel like i\\'m walking on eggshells around my best friend.  I dunno if it\\'s ok to text, to invite him around, or whatever cause i\\'m afraid it\\'s gonna bother him and push him further away.\\n\\nSo i\\'m sure i\\'ve left out a lot of details, but i guess that\\'s the gist of it.  I would appreciate any meaningful advice anyone has to offer, especially if anyone around here has experienced anything similar with a friend.  Thanks to everyone ahead of time for replying.', \"I'm annoyed and tired of living with my brother\\nI have lived with my brother while I'm in college. Ever since I moved in, he has never washed the dishes or swept or mopped or clean anything really. He will only wash the dishes when I'm back home for breaks, and that's because there's no one else to do it for him. Every time my parents come and visit us, I'm the one who has to clean the whole apartment. He doesn't help me with any of that. One time I just snapped because my parents were coming to visit us and I had been cleaning the apartment all day and she wanted me to wash his sheets and clean his bathroom and I said no, if there's one thing he can do when he gets home from work it's take the time to clean his bathroom and wash his sheets. My mom bitched at me because I wouldn't do it. But I'm just so tired of having to do everything myself. In case anyone asks, yes, I do pay my half of the rent with my own money. So it's not fair. I just don't know what to do anymore because I don't like saying things that might make me seem like I'm being dramatic or bratty to my parents. And they know he doesn't clean anything. They know I do it all by myself but they don't ever say anything to him. My parents are just so controlling too. They don't even let me drive anywhere out of town by myself and they sure as hell won't let me live anywhere else. I still have until December when I'll finish school that I'm still gonna have to live with my brother.

Weâ\\x80\\x99re 17 by the way.\\n\\nHowever, whenever we talk itâ\\x80\\x99s always about her life, and her boyfriend. She built up so much courage to dump him only to get back with him the next week. Theyâ\\x80\\x99ve known each other for only a month and he said i love you within a week of them dating. Heâ\\x80\\x99s emotionally manipulative and so immature but she insists that she only tells me the bad things about him not the good things. \\n\\nI want to support her but she makes it so hard. She never asks about my life anymore. Iâ\\x80\\x99m going through a really tough time yet itâ\\x80\\x99s never come up. All we talk about is her and her relationship. I know itâ\\x80\\x99s a big part of her life but it feels like my life is just irrelevant to her.\\n\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ve never drank alcohol or had sex or even been in a relationship so it feels like weâ\\x80\\x99re just drifting apart. I donâ\\x80\\x99t relate to her anymore. \\n\\nObviously I love her loads but it feels like this friendship is one sided and purely based on her. \\n\\nI donâ\\x80\\x99t know whether to keep putting effort into this friendship or not?\\n\\n(using a throwaway bc she knows my account)', 'I Feel Lonely and Scared I\\'ll End Up Friendless. Need an Ear.\\nIve come to the realization that I\\'m really scared I\\'ll end up with no friends. I used to be the type who kept in touch with friends for years. But, I have either lost touch with or outgrown every friend I had in high school. \\n\\nThe new ones I made in college are nice people for the most part and ended up being my roommate group (since sophomore year. I\\'m a 2nd semester junior.). But every friend group has their faults. And with this one, I don\\'t feel like I fit in completely. \\n\\n4 out of the 7 of them are know-it-alls who will try to correct you on every little thing (like one time I was exaggerating and saying somewhere had 100x more people, and one of them came out of their room and said \"Um, I think it\\'s actually 1000x more people.\") Those 4 are also really uptight, don\\'t get my sense of humor for the most part and seem like they\\'re always trying to school me on what\\'s appropriate (MIND YOU I NEVER JOKE ABOUT RACE OR OPPRESSED GROUPS OR ANYTHING OFF LIMITS LIKE THAT.). I just don\\'t always feel seen or appreciated or like my intelligence is respected. There\\'s also one I don\\'t even like that much (no matter how much I\\'ve tried) because she has an arrogant, self-aggrandizing, my-way-or-highway attitude. \\n\\nThe point is I don\\'t always feel in sync with them. Even the ones I do feel in sync with, I don\\'t feel like they reach out to me nearly as much as I reach out them (when we\\'re not in school). And I don\\'t like one-sided friendships. I\\'m worried we won\\'t stay friends after undergrad. \\n\\nAlso this year, 2 of them are graduating and I have to find a new roommate to fill in the spot that\\'ll be in my room. I\\'ll admit, I didn\\'t make enough effort to hang out with people outside of my dorm, and everyone had settled into their friend groups so it\\'s harder to make friends now with the people at my school. I don\\'t know what to do. \\n\\nPart of me feels this is my fault for not getting a single in the first place, and trying to join this friend group when it was already established. They eventually came to see me as a member, and we\\'ve had good times but I don\\'t know that these are \"my people\".\\n\\nAnd part of me wants to get a single room next year, but I feel like I\\'ll just be jumpstarting my social isolation and I\\'m also scaredy new roommates might be lunatics. \\n\\nTl;dr - I\\'ve lost touch/outgrown my high school friends, don\\'t fit in with my college friends, and am scared to end up alone without any friends. Need advice. ', 'Mother is always trying to start something.\\nMy mom and I have a rocky relationship, I love my mom but sometimes I absolutely cannot stand her or the things she does. It stems from her depression that she has, but she always blames everything in the world for her problems and never herself. Yesterday, she texted me that my grandparents were moving from our hometown they\\'ve lived in since the 80\\'s and to the town where more of our family lives. I sent a picture of my discount card from my job and said they could use it if they needed to buy boxes or moving supplies. She replied with \"That\\'s it no emotion?\" Should I have been more emotional to the situation? I don\\'t blame my grandparents for moving because I moved out of state last year. I don\\'t care what my grandparents decide to do because it\\'s their decision to move. I don\\'t blame them for moving at all.', 'My Best Friend Feels More Like My Daughter\\nI love my best friend like family and if anything were to happen to her, you can know I\\'d be there in an instant. But I feel awful admitting that I really don\\'t like spending time with her anymore.\\n\\nWe\\'re both in our late twenties and I\\'m sort of the only family she has since she severed ties with her parents (a choice I completely agree was for the best). We\\'ve been best friends for the past decade and I\\'ve seen her through some really difficult times.\\n\\nShe\\'s faced a lot of struggles, mostly stemming from the terrible relationship she had with her family and the financial burden separating from them put on her life. Unfortunately, many of those struggles are ongoing and have really dominated our friendship. We spend more time talking about her problems than we do hanging out.\\n\\nI\\'ve gotten up at 3:00am to talk with her on the phone because she had a nightmare and she\\'s scared. I\\'ve left my job early to go help her because she left hers early in tears. Days that are supposed to be fun (a movie, a game night, making dinner together) end up with me supporting her because she\\'s upset about something, and suddenly the whole evening is gone. I don\\'t want to exaggerate, but I\\'d say 70% of the times I see her I have to go into \"support mode.\"\\n\\nAnd unfortunately, I\\'ve realized that I don\\'t enjoy her as a friend and I honestly don\\'t think I ever will again. The dynamic of our friendship has changed and it\\'s never going to be what it was. Don\\'t get me wrong, I care deeply for her and want to be there for her if she needs me, but the fact of that matter is I\\'ve found myself not reaching out to her anymore because it\\'s just not a pleasant experience. When we do hang out, it\\'s not because I want to; it\\'s because I feel that\\'s what she needs. She\\'s a burden. She\\'s a burden I bear willingly. But she\\'s a burden.\\n\\nI don\\'t know what to do. I really wish there were an easy way to say \"I don\\'t like you anymore, so please don\\'t be hurt that I don\\'t reach out, but god you don\\'t know how much I care about you.\"', \"Sick and tired of my family and my sister's fiance\\nSo what I'm about to share is a very, very long story so I'll try to shorten it without leaving out too much info for better context of the situation. \\n\\nMy fiance, we've been together for 3 years, is currently in basic training. There were a few rough patches before he left, partly due to the fact that he wanted to get married before leaving. I love him to death and I know he wanted to get married to get the benefits started but I didn't want to base our marriage off of benefits. I know it won't be and I know he wants to do his best to help us. When I asked why he joined, he said one of the main reasons is to provide more for us and to take care of me, which I'm grateful for but I never wanted him to feel like it was all on his shoulders. That's why we planned to move out towards the end of the year and why I'm on college, to be independent, have stability and create my identity.\\n\\nNow for background info, my fiance and I have been living with my sister and her fiance along with our younger brother; our brother has Autism.  Our mother lost the house due to her opioid addiction and we found a place for us to rent together. Our dad left the state the summer before my senior year of high school. So as always my sister and i pick up the pieces and make sure our brother is taken care of. We all have been living together for almost 3 years. Since we've moved into our most recent house, it has been a shit show. 100% of the drama that occurs in the house is due to her fiances family and they don't even live or pay any bills here! Surprisingly after a year of being here they've calmed down but my fiance and I are tired of it. Also I need the ability to live my life and grow as an individual. Having to hold back and set aside my needs and wants is getting tiresome. I barely even want to have children of my own because ive been a parent to my own brother. I don't feel comfortable where I'm at now, I feel like I'm only here because it is convenient, I don't feel appreciated at all. I know my sister wants to keep the family together, or what little we have left but I need room to breathe. Also when I was 16 her fiance offered oral sex to me, I know I should have told her but I also knew she wouldn't have believed me especially given that he is her first everything. I still feel uncomfortable  around him at times.\\n\\n My sister cares and trys her best. She wants to buy a house and move down to Texas, that's where we used to live before pcsing to Washington state. I understand the position she was put in, we both had to endure the chaos that was our family these last few years, well since I was in the 8th grade really. However, her goals and mine don't align and I don't feel like compromising those for anyone else anymore. \\n\\nMy fiance and I just want some peace and the ability to deal with our own problems, in peace without hearing people argue in the next room. We had a plan to move out towards the end of the year but he didn't want to wait. He was even going to school, he had started his first quarter. I asked him to consider the reserves because he could go to school and when he's done move on to active duty but with him being so stubborn he went active.\\n\\n It's not that I never wanted him to join, my father served 22 years and I want to join as well. I'll support him for however long his career will be but now I'm trying to figure out how do I move on and start my own family. Not that it'll  include children right away, but just my fiance and I. \\n\\nWhen we get married he will be my priority and my family as well, I just don't want my sister thinking I've chosen him over them. But also I need to make decisions for myself. Just about every decision I've made has always needed me to make sure I'm available for other people. I'm tired of always being available. My sister sometimes acts as if she takes care of our brother on her own but that is far from the truth. We've both had to do the same and yet I don't think she really appreciates it, at least she won't until I move with my fiance. \\n\\nI'm not sure if many of you are familiar with this term but enmeshment is the term I'd use to describe my family. There is no boundaries and if you deviate from their mean then you're an oddball. \\n\\nI know I said I'd try to keep it short and this isn't even half of it. I want and going to move with my fiance after I've graduated and we are married. He's getting deployed after OSUT, so I'm thinking it'll be best to get married after and itll keep some stress away from having to worry about doing before he leaves. \\n\\nI appreciate anyone that takes the time to read this, advice is greatly appreciated.\", 'What\\'s the deal with my husband\\'s future best friends wife?\\nHi everyone, I am having a problem and I\\'m not sure what to do about it. I am led to believe that my future husband\\'s (married next month) best friend\\'s wife dislikes me, but I\\'m getting mixed signals. I have always (I thought) been nice to her. \\n\\nWhen we hang out as couples, everything is fine and we get along great.

We even all took a road trip together this past summer a few states away to attend a very lovely (albeit very strange) wedding of another of their mutual friends, and we went out to dinner and shopping while the boys were at the bachelor party. \\n\\nIt seems like whenever I try to plan anything though, she isn\\'t available, even if her husband is. I planned a surprise party for my fiances 30th birthday that I had been talking about for months--her husband was there, and at the last minute, she couldn\\'t attend. He didn\\'t even tell me she wasn\\'t coming until he showed up without her. We visited their home on 4th of July weekend and there invited them to my parents house (they have a pool) for the holiday. He showed up, she didn\\'t because she was \"sick\" (read: hungover.) Her husband showed up for an hour or so and she was continually calling him asking when he was going to come home and take care of her. \\n\\nThe thing that makes me think this isnt a string of coincidences is my bridal shower. It is tomorrow, and I have found out she will not be attending. She Rsvpd to my mom with just a generic \"I can\\'t make it, we\\'re busy\" but then a few days later, her husband messaged my fiance asking if he wanted to hang out on the day of my shower.\\n\\nI have always been nice to her, and I\\'m not sure whats going on.

I live at home after graduating from college with my mom because I'm in the process of planning my career and finding a job to move out eventually. The thing is its like being in hell when you have a mother with clear mental problems bullying you all the time. She constantly needs attention and if she doesn't get it she changes the locks or threatens me with an eviction notice or tries to remove all the food from the house knowing I don't have anywhere to go and I'm doing all I can as fast as I possibly can to move out. I don't eat much because even if I consume a dollar to 4 dollars worth of food a week she still says I'm eating her out of house and home. I work on my portfolio from sunrise to sunset daily so I'm in my room 90 percent of the time but she accuses me of being secretive because she can't know every little thing I do. She doesn't believe in boundaries and my mental health has suffered greatly because of it.

She tries to guilt trip me into taking her back. She bought me a gift while visiting in Korea and wanted to give it to me this Saturday. I said ok at first but sent her a text this morning declining the gift and the offer. I feel guilty. Am I wrong? \\n\\n\\n**Long Story (detailed)**:   \\n      \\n   My friend and I had been friends since high school ( I am now 23 and she is now 21). I ended our friendship this summer after giving her numerous chances over the years. Long story shortish, she would never keep her word when it came to meeting up, she was super inconsistent and only really reached out when it was convenient for her. She would always be \"too busy\", she\\'d change our plans to hang out with others, or she\\'d flake out all together and not call or show. We both went to separate colleges in different towns so meeting up was hard and hanging out regularly was pretty difficult. I was always the one who would reach out to see how she was doing and I was always the one to initiate are hang out sessions. We would make plans to meet up a month in advance and the week of our planned day, she would flake out. After a while, I started calling her out and she would beg and cry exclaiming that she would change, but she never did. I would text her and she\\'d never text back. I called her once after a hard day at school and she rushed me off the phone but whenever she would call me for help and advice I was always there front and center ready to listen. I would ask her to help me out and she bail at the last minute due to scheduling conflict or her failing to think ahead. I once asked her to pick me up from the airport. I asked 3 times if she was sure if she could and she reassured me that she\\'d be able to. A couple of days before the day that she was supposed to pick me up, she calls me talking in circles only to tell me that she couldn\\'t do it. I was broke and couldn\\'t really afford a lyft. Luckily I was able to reach my dad. \\n      \\n\\n  Over the summer things got even worse. She turned 21 and I had tried several times to link up and take her out. She bailed both times. The first time she bailed because I guess she forgot that she needed to pick up her aunt from the airport. The second time she made date night plans with her boyfriend. It continued to persist. she was teaching me how to drive but didn\\'t think enough of me to let me know when she was going to cancel. Instead, she ghosted me for a week only to blame it on the fact that she was too busy to text me or call me. \\n      In September, I had had it! I deleted her on facebook and i blocked her number. She added me back a week later and then I blocked her. Feeling bad, November I reached out one last time to see if we could talk things through. She said that she missed me and was too sad to talk in person and that she need time to process what happened. I rolled my eyes at the text and said whatever. Toward the end of the month (November 19th to exact) she reaches out to me telling me about how sorry she is how awful of a friend she was. I vented my frustrations and she said apologized and alluded to wanting yet another chance. I said ok and we planned to meet on December 22nd. \\n      \\n\\n   A few days before December 22nd, she texts me saying that the 22nd didn\\'t work for her. She tried to place the blame on me by saying that I knew that she had job training that day and that I should\\'ve picked another day. I went off, She begs, I say whatever. Sometime goes by and we talk again and I explain everything that is on my mind. I tell her that its cool to be busy but its also important to make time for the people in her life. She didn\\'t really respond because I guess it was finals week on her end. I told her that I would always be there for her and I wished her the best of luck.\\n       \\n\\nOn New Years she texted me telling me that she had been thinking about me and she wished me a Happy New Year. I did the same. A few days later she texts me saying that she bought me a gift in Korea (where she had been visiting) and I said ok? I was a little irritated because I know that it was just another nice-nice sappy guilt trip manipulation ploy. We settled for meeting up on Saturday. however after thinking about it, I texted her today and told her that meeting up isn\\'t a good idea. I told her that while she is a very sweet person and that I appreciated the gift, I do not trust her. I told her that I have since moved on and healed from the situation. I included that if she wanted to speak on the phone on Saturday that we could but outside of that I would not feel comfortable meeting up and hanging out. She texted me back a little short saying \"Oh ok\" and she asked if she could text me later. I said sorry and told her to take care. \\n   \\n\\n  *Am I wrong? I feel a little guilty for how messy this entire thing has been but Im over feeling used and manipulated. She thinks that if she \"gives\" me gifts and or cries and begs for me to give her another chance that I give in. I mean it this time.. Ive gone back on my word so many times with her because of guilt and not wanting to seem like a bitch. She doesnt have many friends and I was kind of her should but she always had a hard time returning the favor. Should I meet up with her and accept the gift? Or should I just let sleep dogs lie???*\\n\\n', 'feeling betrayed\\nMy best friend and I are dating two guys who are also best friends and roommates.

(She definitely was not and they were all being extremely judgemental without knowing her full story) I totally disagreed with them and confronted them about it.

I was so excited for her, and she had asked about what my favorite things to do when I was there were. I knew that she would love the view from the empire state building and decided to buy her a ticket up as a christmas gift. When I gave her the gift, she was really excited but as her trip has come and gone it is apparent that she didn't go despite texting me multiple times on the trip saying how excited she was and mentioning vague plans for when she might go up. I know she arrived with little to no real plans for the entire week and spent a lot of time wandering, which is why I feel that letting the gift go to waste is kind of disrespectful. I also feel that if she were upfront and let me know that she didn't go would be much better than trying to ignore that it happened. I want to know what other people's thoughts on this are before I talk to her, and also maybe how to approach her about it because this is something that is uncharacteristic of her and kind of hurtful to me. \", 'bad friend\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ve been friends with this guy for a few months now.

Had a pretty typical life growing up. Had a really stereotypical family - mom, dad, sister, and me. Had good friends growing up, moved schools as a kid only once, and had stuff I was passionate about. During my sophomore year of high school though, my parents got divorced, and shortly after, I had some events happen in my life that sent me into a deep depression. I became suicidal. Now mind you, up through this point, I have had a close knit group of about 8 of us. One girl and I had been friends for almost 7 years and generally I got along with pretty much anyone. \\n\\nThen this guy I knew from performing arts stuff and I ended up going into a relationship. He was 4 years older than me, meaning he was in college when we started dating, I had barely turned 16 and never had been in a serious relationship, he was charming and wanted me to â\\x80\\x9cnot be so naiveâ\\x80\\x9d and - if you canâ\\x80\\x99t already see the warning signs - this became an extremely abusive relationship, in pretty much every way possible starting with emotional abusive, escalating to physical abuse, and eventually sexual abuse. It completely destroyed me as a person. He forced me to end friendships with anyone who tried to help get away from him, which ended up being all of my friends. Eventually, my college roommate helped me escape from him and helped me to get a restraining order during my Freshman year of college.\\n\\nThankfully, Iâ\\x80\\x99m in a really wonderful relationship with someone incredibly kind and supportive and have been for nearly 5 years. But with the exception of my boyfriend now, I havenâ\\x80\\x99t been able to connect with people like I used to before that abusive relationship. Some friends I had back then, friends I loved dearly, never forgave me for ending the friendship, despite the fact I never wanted to. And it still really hurts. \\n\\nI mostly have had off and on friendships through recent years. Mostly the story is: I start talking to a potential friend, we quickly find a bunch of similarities and similar humor, become close really quickly, they become avoidant/ distant/ flakey (or in a recent case - manipulative) and I get upset and end the friendship. Iâ\\x80\\x99m quick to forgive and a HUGE pushover, and people really take advantage of this and at some point, I realize this and thatâ\\x80\\x99s when I get upset.\\n\\nThe other story is that I start to slowly build friendships, like with people at work, and I think things are going well and I come to realize they donâ\\x80\\x99t really care to be anything more than work friends or they donâ\\x80\\x99t like me as much as I thought they did. I currently have 2 friends that I really care about. One of them lives really far and I only get to see occasionally. The other has started to use the busy excuse with me, but then she plasters her hanging out with everyone but me on social media, but the goes on about how she misses me so much and wishes we could hang out. She literally only lives 20 minutes away and she either flakes or lies about being busy working. Itâ\\x80\\x99s starting to really bring me down and I feel really down about it since I feel like itâ\\x80\\x99s something that ultimately ends up happening no matter how hard I try or how good of friends we are.\\n\\nTo sum everything up, I feel like Iâ\\x80\\x99m at a loss and I have a hard time connecting with anyone.

She went on to say say \"but i\\'m your mom, I can ask things like that.\" I understand she has a much different point of view, especially because she\\'s older, but I just personally feel it\\'s disrespectful to say that I don\\'t love my boyfriend and that \"he\\'s just a friend.\" She kind of rolled her eyes at me, flatly said goodnight, and hung up.\\n\\nAm I overreacting? i feel like I shouldn\\'t be guilty for expressing my feelings of being uncomfortable with the questions she asks me.

Thoughts?', '26 thinking of moving family upset\\n\\nOkay so this past 5 months have been overwhelming. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve had a lot of major things happen. I got married in October and over the past year Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been connecting with my father and half brothers (who I just consider brotthers) and that whole side off the family. My dads never been apart of my life. I saw him probably about 4 times out of my 26 years on earth. The last time until this past week I saw my dad was when I was 10 so 16 years ago. That was also the last time I ever flew on a plane. I decided to fly down about two weeks ago for a week and I had such a good time connecting with my brothers and my oldest brothers wife and my nephew and grandparents and everyone! I loved the idea of everyone together closely and always at each others houses and I got along so well with my brothers and it was really nice. My brother and sister in law decide to that theyâ\\x80\\x99re going to move back to Florida where my dad and dads family is and they all really want me to move there. They love the idea of us getting close as a family and setting traditions and spending holidays together. Honestly I love that idea. My problem is my mother raised me, sheâ\\x80\\x99s always been there for me. She has nobody other than me. She doesnâ\\x80\\x99t even have a car I drive her places. My grandmother who is also soo important to me sheâ\\x80\\x99s my second mother sheâ\\x80\\x99s been in a nursing home for 10 years and sheâ\\x80\\x99s confused a lot but still not that confused. The thought of leaving them makes me want to cry and I feel like I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t. My mom would feel so betrayed and angry at me. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s already feeling a little hurt because Iâ\\x80\\x99m getting closer with my dad that family. Which is wrong but she has a lot of issues of her own. The thought of leaving my grandma I could never. :( I just donâ\\x80\\x99t know what to do. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve never left NY my husband also has his father here and his father would hate me if I brought â\\x80\\x9chis sonâ\\x80\\x9d away. My husband acts like he dose not care but ofcose he must. I just donâ\\x80\\x99t know what to do I feel so stuck like if I even considered moving Iâ\\x80\\x99d feel so selfish and horrible. I couldnâ\\x80\\x99t leave my mom and I feel like she wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t come with me sheâ\\x80\\x99d be so angry that I was â\\x80\\x9cchoosing my father who did nothing for me and his family who ignored meâ\\x80\\x9d over staying near her.

I donâ\\x80\\x99t want my life to pass away and miss it all. Ever since I came back from visiting them for a week my mom has been giving me such a guilt trip about spending my money to go visit them or how she feels used and itâ\\x80\\x99s crazy to me.

Thanks for listening forever did.', 'Advice\\nTo preface this, I wanna say that I feel pathetic/incompetent/exhausted.\\n\\nFemale, 30, currently staying at a hotel because I had to leave the house I was living in because of a conflict that recently happened. I got into a verbal argument with my sister (34) that resulted into a physical altercation. She screamed \"Go kill yourself\" and then shoved me and scratched me. My father was a witness to this. I then called the cops because i felt unsafe, she got so angry and turned a bit violent. (This is the third time she\\'s told me to go kill myself and my parents haven\\'t told her anything). Right before the cops came she was arguing with my dad and told me to \"Shut the f*** up! \\n\\nThe cops arrived I told one of the cops my side of the story and she told hers. She said that I attacked her and that there were scratch marks on both her arms. I told the cops how could that be when none of the nails on my right hand are very short (I swear to you I couldn\\'t have scratched seeing since I had no nails on one hand. The nails on my right hand are VERY short because they all broke due to cleaning the kitchen cabinets etc). The cops didn\\'t believe me. My sister also claimed that I\\'m \"bipolar\" which I\\'m not. So the cops believed my sister and took me away on a 5150. I was released 3 hours later because the case manager said I didn\\'t have any mental health issues. \\n\\nThe funny thing is that I told my parents that I wanted permission to use their car to leave that house because I couldn\\'t handle the stress that came with living with her. I would eventually return the car once I moved, got myself established etc. The stress has caused me to lose 3 pounds this week alone. \\n\\nAfter returning from the behavior health services, I gathered  my bag and one suitcase and left. Currently, I\\'m staying at a hotel. \\n\\nWhat hurts most of all is that my parents have never told my sister to stop telling me to kill myself. It\\'s as if thy don\\'t care. This is such a shitty experience that I wouldn\\'t wish upon anyone. \\n\\nI\\'m a hotel with no car, no friends, no home. \\n\\nIs it bad that to think that I just wanted my parents to tell her to stop telling me to kill myself.

My best friend is like my sister and has been there for me through really hard times, and I've been there for her. We're similar in so many ways, run a small blog together and I love her to bits. On new years eve she was set up with a guy and they've been dating ever since. Since their first date, we hardly talk. She doesn't even want to talk about him much, and when she does she talks about quitting her job for him, and that he wants to spend the rest of his life with her. They go out drinking a lot, almost every night, it seems like he spoils her and she's told me she's really happy. \\nBut at the same time her anxiety is still bad. She's lost her ambition to travel, adventure and take up new hobbies. She doesn't contribute to the blog anymore but says she still wants to carry it on (our domain doesn't expire until July). I feel like I've lost my best friend, but I'm mostly scared that she's already lost herself because of a guy and I just don't know what to do. I've stopped chasing her for plans because she's always busy now (we used to meet up weekly), and stopped messaging because there won't be a reply. She checks up on me every now and then and I haven't been doing well at all, but I don't want the few times we talk to be negative and depressing. I just feel so clueless right now and I miss her. Any advice? \", 'Drug addict friend!!?\\nI have had this best friend for over 8 years now. We were childhood friends and basically grew up together. The past 2 years were a little rough because he started to drink heavily in high school. Later on he started to dabble into drugs  and the â\\x80\\x9cparty lifeâ\\x80\\x9d. Once he started doing that, I kind of distanced myself because I didnâ\\x80\\x99t know how to react. I was kind of mad but also sad so I didnâ\\x80\\x99t really talk to him as much.

I never said this, I said it wasn\\'t math focused. Plus she herself said she is having an easy time). She constantly asks me if I think she is intelligent and I always tell her she\\'s smart in her own way like everyone is. Anyway, I said sorry and have a good holiday but she didn\\'t reciprocate and just told me to watch what I say and not to tell anyone she said this.\\n\\n  This isn\\'t the first time this kind of thing happened.

We dated four years and the day we married was the best day of my life. We immediately became pregnant with our daughter, who is now 5. A couple of years later we welcomed our son (now almost 3).  \\n\\nBrief introduction of us - I\\'m almost 41 and she almost 37. I work full time and she recently became a stay at home mom.  We are middle class, homeowners living in Seattle, college degrees, financially responsible, socially liberal on most issues, have good friend circle (many with similar aged children), good family support live in area. Both of us raised in healthy and happy traditional nuclear homes. Our traditional marriage is good and based on trust, but I won\\'t lie and say the last 5 years of raising two children hasn\\'t been without its challenges and occasional spat. But we married for life, and at the altar when I said I do forever, I meant it. Overall, we are fortunate and thankful for our lives.\\n\\nAfter the birth of our second child, I was done.  I had considered getting a vasectomy (snipped). Many of my dad friends had done it and recommended I do it. My wife was against it, and I wasn\\'t really wanting to do it either for other reasons.\\n\\nMy wife always semi-joked she wanted another kid, and had quipped she felt incomplete and that being a mother is her calling.  She is an excellent, patient mother to our children.  However, I felt it was a phase and she could get her \"baby fix\" with friends newborns.  I did not feel a need to have another child, and was quite against it. I was frank with her on the matter, but because of the differing opinion and emotional confrontation, we avoided discussing it at length.\\n\\nFast forward to 2 weeks ago when my wife informs me she missed her period and sure she is pregnant. No visits to the doctor yet to confirm, but we have never had problems conceiving, and I believe she is pregnant.  Our birth control was her counting her monthly cycle, which she is pretty good at.  I always reached for a condom just in case, but she does not like using them and told me it was not needed. Well we slipped one past the goalie.  \\n\\nWhen she told me, I reacted poorly, saying it would mess up the good thing we had going, I was tired and didn\\'t have the energy, our family was complete already.  Not to mention the fact that it was be financially very difficult (we\\'d have to buy a larger house and I don\\'t need to tell you what Seattle real estate is like). We are quite squeezed in our little home already. I told her she would have to go back to work. I asked her to terminate the pregnancy. To sum it up, it wasn\\'t the reaction she was hoping to hear.\\n\\nThe next week I bounced between many emotions. Anger, for upsetting our lives, even considering the idea she intentionally got pregnant. Fear, that our stable little family might crumble, that 3 makes an odd man out and the children would suffer. Fear, that she isn\\'t healthy for this, as she is showing some physical ailments/breakdown that shouldn\\'t be ignored and having another child will only fixing those off further. Fear, that I\\'m suffering physical ailments as well and don\\'t have the energy to go through another round of caring for an infant. Fear, that both her parents and mine are elderly and close to needing care from us, and that they won\\'t be there to be the \"relief valve\" and help with watching the kids when we need it. Anxiousness, that we had just got out of having the kids in diapers and were just starting the \"next phase\" of our children being autonomous and doing activities I could participate in. Guilt, for crushing her dreams and not supporting the idea of a third child when its something she wants very badly. \\n\\nOne day I wrote out an objective list of reasons (many of which are cited above) why having a third child was a bad idea. After a few more days of trying to ignore the issue, we had our blowup.  I presented her my list and she listened, acknowledging they were valid and made sense. She then countered with her belief that this was meant to be, and she could not in good conscious have an abortion. It would stay with her forever and she says she would never get over it, and would forever resent me for pushing the issue.  I told her I might resent the child and her for letting this happen.   I slept on the couch that night, feeling disgust and bitterness.\\n\\nThe next morning there was nothing else to do but discuss it more. I again said I wasn\\'t interested, and she can\\'t force this on me. She again countered with her same argument that it was meant to be, that our \"next phase\" of children would just have to wait a few more years.  I yelled I would be almost 60 years old at this child\\'s high school graduation. I want to play sports with my kids and be active, not the \"old dad\". I said I wouldn\\'t care, not even over the name we would give it. I said I wound\\'t go with her to the doctor appointment.  I told her she was being selfish and not putting what she has now over what she might have. She told me she would start contacting a divorce lawyer if this was how it was going to be.\\n\\nIt\\'s only been a few days since that talk, but I am completely stunned and not myself.  I was a zombie at work, not able to focus on anything. At home I\\'ve been short tempered and avoiding everything.  I\\'ve cried in my car, cried in the bathroom. Borderline panic attacks.  I\\'m frantically researching mental health professionals, as I need to talk to someone. I haven\\'t seen a counselor since before we were married.  I can\\'t talk to my family or friends until the doctor visit to confirm the pregnancy.  I feel like an absolute asshole for saying the things I said and my attitude, and I can\\'t take that back. Even if it isn\\'t a viable pregnancy, or she miscarries, I\\'ve made my mark and she will always think less of me. I\\'m scared she regrets even having ever met me.  I absolutely DO NOT want to break up our family, I love my children and family. I am certain a divorce would ruin all of us.  \\n\\nWe are at an absolute impasse. She is set in her mind, the only thing that could stop this is the doctor saying she or the baby are not healthy and viable. \\n\\nI\\'m beside myself. It\\'s not that I don\\'t love children, I really do. And I know I\\'ll still love the child regardless, it\\'s not the child\\'s fault and they should not be treated unfairly. And she may be right, that it is only raising another baby is temporary and it\\'ll pass and everything will be OK and we will all be happier. But what if it\\'s not? What if this was a bad idea and our quality of life is destroyed? What if I do resent her, or she resents me because of my opinion. What if her feeling of being \"incomplete\" is just a phase and she really just misses doting on a newborn. What if that feeling doesn\\'t go away after a third child? Am I the selfish one? Are my doubts unreasonable?  What can I do? \\n', \"My male cousin stopped talking to me all of sudden.\\nLet's call my cousin Bobby.\\n\\nMy mother is the oldest daugther and my aunt (her sister, and Bobby's mother) is the youngest, with an age gap of 15 years old and even though they weren't really close (my mom moved to another province when she turned 18 and didn't came back to where we live now until she was 43, 2 years after my birth), we used to see each other at least 2 times in a week.\\nI'm an only child while he is the youngest of 2 sons and since he's only 3 years older than me, my mom and my aunt thought it'd be nice to make us spend time together.

Hell, he doesn't even look at me when I open the door. A year ago, during New Year's Eve, we were sitting in front of each other during dinner and I was staring at him because he looks really good now that he lost the acne. He noticed what I was doing so I moved my gaze to one of my cousin's baby and when I looked back at him, he avoided my gaze.\\n\\nI told my friends about him and they say that he must be embarrassed about something but I dunno about what or why since he never did something weird or bad to me. \\n\\nAll of my other relatives told me he would start talking to me again when he got older and mature. But oh surprise: he is now 20 and at college, and he still doesn't talk to me and avoid my gaze. \", \"How do I get my Best Friend back..\\nLast year me and one of my Best friend decided to get into a relationship.. it lasted a couple of months and she got disturbed due to some personal problems and i made a mistake of not giving her space as obviously I was worried as a boyfriend and also the best friend because she won't share what happened to her  and truly it was something bad..\\nWe both had an amazing Friendship of 6 years before that and there may not have been a single day that went by without talking to each other.. its like she became an integral part of my life..\\nBut after she started to distance herself from the relationship I did keep bothering her which was a mistake on my part and I did apologize to her for that.. \\nshe kept blocking and unblocking me since then and I tried my best to get back our friendship as it matters to me more than a relationship as out of the few people who truly know me and are as important as the organs of my body she is one of them..\\nand as we know even without one organ a person feels Handicapped as I do now...\\nYes it might be selfish of me as I am the only one who wants the friendship to be like before.. all of my attempts have failed so far.. but its next to impossible to not think of her as she was my routine for past 6 years..\\nand I too tried the regular methods suggested everywhere like cutting contact, getting busy, etc but at the end of the day you always have some time for yourself and in that time her thoughts always come to my mind...\\n \", 'Longtime close friend, brand-new bewilderment\\nMy friend is distractable. He thinks irrationally. And he barely listens anymore.\\n\\nI feel as though I\\'ve become a pane of glass or a mirror to him. When we\\'re in a car together, he drones on about things (tell me if this has happened to you) he\\'s told me many times before. Occasionally, in the middle, there\\'s an admission: \"I probly told you this before, but..\". However, the story always continues, even if I briefly recap the story for him. When it\\'s obvious the information has been shared, the most pressing imperative seems to be on reiterating it. Perhaps I didn\\'t give the desired response the first time. I get the feeling he just doesn\\'t care whether I\\'d like to hear it. I also possess conversational preferences, and they never include hearing the same story twice. After countless reccurences of this scenario, it seems that my considerations aren\\'t really valued or remembered. Mentally, he seems to be on a train and passengers (myself included) are always bustling through and, as such, might just seem replaceable.\\n\\nThere doesn\\'t seem anymore to be a genuine interest in my take on things. Questions are rarely asked, and if they are, they\\'re poised in such a way as to elicit some agreeable response. We\\'ve never had a problem with differing opinions, but lately there is a marked disinterest in mine. If I express perhaps a different perspective I might share on something, he\\'s typically halfway through deconstructing it and preparing a rebuttal by the time I\\'ve reached the bulk of my first sentence. Lately, I make sure to be concise. 10-word sentences. Brief, clear declarations with stipulations kept to a minimum. I do this in a sincere effort to make sure at least some of my thoughts reach him via this channel called speech. I feel a little like a sidekick, implicitly expected to go along with whatever is said or suggested and quietly supporting. I have needs and I make sure they\\'re met. I just make sure, now, that they\\'re met completely before I go into a conversation or endeavor with him.\\n\\nThe attention span has completely plummeted. He and his phone might as well have fused into one entity. Often times, when we\\'re driving somewhere, or at our shared place of work, he will open a conversation. What he desires to be communicated is seemingly achieved. I give plenty of time, listening quietly and waiting a few seconds before responding. When I respond, sometimes I\\'ll be surprised that I\\'ve been able to speak for a couple of sentences without being interrupted. Then, I\\'ll look up and almost invariably, he\\'s on his phone texting, on social media, or looking at boobs. I fall silent and look at him, stopping my speech, and sometimes there\\'s a feigned response that hazily resembles some degree of mental assimilation. Other times, my input is simply ignored. I feel often that I am relegated to silence by virtue of necessity. What is the point of talking or even attempting to share with someone if they feel their device is more important than you? When there is no device involved, the listening is of such low quality that I feel as though I\\'m viewed as a shadow, or some reflective panel that occasionally flashes some piece of light which sparks a brief reaction.\\n\\nI use the word reaction explicitly to differentiate from response. Responding, to me, would be careful consideration of the texture of the exchange. What I see falls on a spectrum between bristling and hyperenthusiastic. Everything in the observable behavior appears to come from an emotionally fueled place. I long ago ceased trying to appeal to logic and reason, because there seems to be a fantasy aspect to his formulations about reality, business, and essentially learning in general. An obstinate and vigorous type of chauvinism appears when the discussion involves logically based and scientifically supported criterion as pillars of discussion. \"Have you ever thought that maybe our ideas about science are just implanted by society, and another race has fully influenced our evolution as human beings?\" (to imply that the scrutiny intrinsic to the scientific community\\'s assimilation of data is too dismissive toward fringe and pseudoscientific contributions). \"Physics is just one way to understand reality; there are physics we aren\\'t even aware of that we won\\'t know about for hundreds of years\" (as a soft excuse or rationale to discredit or invalidate the advances in modern physics and thus not include them in discussion). \"Can you prove to me that 1 + 1 = 2?\" (in a maddening conversation I had with him whereupon he elected to discredit all mathematics by attempting to upend the premise that numbers can accurately represent ideas).\\n\\nI love math and physics because it helps accurately explain the world I live in. I can\\'t share any of that enthusiasm with him, though, because his defenses rise as he falls lure to the siren of unreasonably ambiguous premises of belief. I get it; it represents flexibility and fluidity. There\\'s no pinning someone \\ndown for their rationales or justifications if they honestly feel their ideas reside above the established and fair principles of unbiased scientific criticism. The implication seems to be that it\\'s a lot more fun and even more reasonable to live in the dark, because anything a person makes up could be true, and the absence of scrutiny works synergistically to provide disincentives for the need for proof.\\n\\nWe have been friends since third grade. We\\'re both in our thirties now. We\\'ve remained close and shared lots of valuable experiences. Emotionally, we\\'re there for each other and that\\'s always what we\\'ve been best at. But I feel this insistence on the employment of a deductive philosophy of thinking which ignores outside criteria in favor of \"empathetic\" consult has wedged a chasm between us. I can\\'t really tell if it\\'s me or him whom has done the most changing in the last few years, but rest assured, I am working at a 100% level of effort to rectify what issues there are and reforge our understandings.\\n\\nA personal aside:  Three years ago, I experienced a rather significant mental shift. I began to make efforts to look at the world more objectively, understanding better how I was not the focal point of existence. I took myself down a few notches, and in doing so, became irrevocably drawn to learning about the finer workings of the world in which I lived.  During this time, I had the pleasure of working with a young man seven years my junior with whom I could seemingly achieve no middle ground. Even just a casual extended conversation seemed unbearable. We came from different places and really just resigned ourselves to tolerating one another. For a long while, I just couldn\\'t put my finger on what bugged me about the guy. Then, about six months in, it hit me: I was unable to reasonably share anything I had learned, without it being scrutinized needlessly by way of the contrast of his own biased interpretations. The scrutiny itself didn\\'t bother me; it was the nature of the uncredentialed and entitled rebuttals. They had little basis in scientific sourcing and did not stand stand up well to criticism. The young man\\'s ideas about the world were essentially all based on his own experience, and there appeared to be no real desire in him to contrast those findings with a collective reality outside of his own.  I eventually came to realize I didn\\'t like the kid because he reminded me of me.\\n\\nFrom that point on, I vowed to observe my thought processes more closely. The last thing I wanted was to waste someone\\'s time unwittingly by spewing nonsensical garbage of which I had no demonstrable proof or understanding. I read about using proper reasoning and recognizing logical fallacies. I worked to become more mindful toward my own irrational inclinations. It became tantamount to recognize the ignorances and defenses to which I\\'d become accustomed to clinging, and replace them with the collective wisdom provided by my new best friends: logical and rational thought. As I was doing my best to employ these utilities, I figured I could scarce be assumed a fool and reasonably sort out those ideas which did not hold up to proper scrutiny.\\n\\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, this new method of articulating reality didn\\'t win me many friends. The good ones I\\'ve retained, and those who didn\\'t share this unearthed enthusiasm for inductive reasoning were left behind. This friendship I share with this person seems like a relic of the past me. I don\\'t believe he\\'s shared the same monumental changes in mental processing. He\\'s always had a certain flair for exaggeration and fantasy, and until recently, I just accepted it as face value and dealt with the occasional misunderstandings as I\\'m sure he had with me. Now, however, the implications seem more pronounced. He\\'s running a business and is constantly distracted. The time we share is often saturated by ramblings of fanatical pseudoscience or mysticism which are \\nimpossibly asserted and employ mind-numbingly irrational justifications. The only discipline seems to be that of a zealous allegiance to the fortification of the shared psychological concoctions of the hopefully ignorant. There is little point in rebuttal anymore because, deductively, the answer has already been solved for. And rest assured, 1 + 1 = 2 was not used in this equation.\\n\\nIf indeed there is a future for this friendship, at least on my half, it involves intensely disciplined patience. I feel sometimes like a social worker, intently listening and softly steering the delinquent in a healthier direction. I meditate and identify as Buddhist. I consider myself to be a spiritual person, and I understand that my interpretation of reality is uniquely pixelated in ways that differ from those of others. I work to cultivate higher compassion and practice patience and kindness when I feel a bristling within myself or witness a bristling in others. As such, I feel that just living my values and being a good listener might be the way through this. I can\\'t help but feeling, though, that this is the beginning of a fork in the road which leads to an increasingly fainter sense of collective recognition.', \"So my sister cheated on her husband w/ my best friend (SAD, not a porno)\\nI'm new to reddit so forgive me for not knowing how things are usually done. \\n\\nLink for the story: https://www.reddit.com/r/familydrama/comments/81mbm9/so_my_sister_cheated_on_her_husband_w_my_best/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link\\n\\nOR here it is:\\n(just trying to get people to read this, I'm trying to communicate.)\\n\\nSo my sister (30's) cheated on her husband of 6 years with my best friend (early 20's).

Fight!\\nHey Reddit community, I need to know if Iâ\\x80\\x99m in the wrong in a certain situation...\\n\\nSo a friend and I, lets just call him Kevin, have been good friends for years and have always gotten along (for the most part) pretty well. Earlier this week, though, he was poking fun at me about a certain rumor he had heard about me from a mutual friend of both of ours. The rumor was completely false and out of left field, so much out of left field, that I confronted the mutual friend and asked them what the fuck they were doing. Now, this mutual friend had told my friend Kevin about this rumor and they laughed about it and he made fun of me for it in a pretty brutal, but still jokingly, manner, but decided to drag me in front of the whole squad about it before he asked me whether it was actually true or not. It still bugged me, though, that this mutual friend was talkin shit to who knows who else, spreading this false rumor and whatnot, so I decided to control this mutual friend about the rumor. The mutual friend was surprised that I confronted them about it, and complained to Kevin and thought that it was â\\x80\\x9cweirdâ\\x80\\x9d that I would confront someone who was spreading false shit about me. Now apparently this mutual friend cut ties with me (I think itâ\\x80\\x99s funny and I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t good enough friends with them to actually care), but Kevin is extremely angry at me and we havenâ\\x80\\x99t talked to each other or about it since, making me think that things will naturally go south. I admit I may have overreacted although I donâ\\x80\\x99t think Iâ\\x80\\x99m in the wrong, so I refuse to apologize. Any advice, Reddit community? If I believe that I truly wasnâ\\x80\\x99t in the wrong, should I really apologize for how I handled this?', 'Am I being too harsh?\\nI have a cousin(we\\'ll call him Joe) who is the closest thing I have ever had to a best friend.  We used to do everything together.  Throughout the years we would party our asses off in college, spend holidays together, play video games; literally everything together.  About a year ago, I started to notice that he was making some bad life choices.  Particularly, these bad choices involved drinking and driving, pushing relationships away, and hanging out with the wrong type of people.  At first, it didn\\'t really affect our friendship.  We\\'ve always respected each others separate lives when we weren\\'t hanging out.  It was when I started to notice the changes mentioned above that I started to bring it up.  One weekend, the whole friendship imploded.  \\n\\nSome of my friends were coming into town.  Joe was friends with them as well, so I was planning a great time for all of us.  Friday, we went out to a local bar and were all having fun.  Joe has a girlfriend, who wasn\\'t able to join us until the following Saturday morning due to work obligations.  They had been dating for about 3 months, and Joe had been constantly pushing her away, pretending he didn\\'t care about her when I thought she was a stand up gal that could really help him.  That Friday night, Joe ends up making out with an ugly, fat, unnattractive old acquaintenance of ours.  I confronted Joe and told him to cut the shit or I would knock his ass out.  He stopped messing around with the girl and pretended everything was fine.  I confronted him, calling him out for how he chooses to make his life miserable with his actions.  I forced him to tell his girlfriend what he did.  After sending the text, he drove home drunk from the bar.\\n\\nThe next day, Saturday, my friends, Joe, and I all met up at a local event in my hometown.  Joe apologized to me and said he was glad I was there to make things right.  I forgave him and we proceeded to have a great time at the event(which is basically just a big tailgate party).  Near the end of the day, Joe\\'s girlfriend was finally able to show up and join the festivities.  She didn\\'t seem bothered by his actions of the previous night, which made me happy because Joe needed someone like her in his life.  Well, as the evening continued, Joe wouldn\\'t stop drinking.  I kept telling him to take it easy, but it was in his head that he wanted to keep the party going at any rate.\\n\\nThat evening, Joe ditched me and everyone in the group, including his girlfriend, to go to the bars with some random people he met at the local event.  We were all there together, and then he disappeared, gone without a trace or text.  He told his girlfriend to wait in a near by parking lot while he finished partying.  She ended up calling me, crying, asking me to help her find him.  I tried to call Joe multiple times, and was ignored and sent to voicemail.  At this point, I\\'m full of rage from his actions now and the night prior.  Why would he treat me, his \"best friend\", and his girlfriend like this?  I text him, saying how upset I am and that he needs to be a man and figure his life out becuase he\\'s pushing those closest to him away.  Later that night(around 2AM), I get calls from people at the local event that know me saying that he is making out with random chicks again and eventually was arrested by the police.  They\\'re telling me to come get him before the police take him to jail.  I refuse.  Turned out he didn\\'t actual get arrested(so he claimed), I\\'ve never found out the truth of that night.\\n\\nIt\\'s been over a year since I\\'ve talked to him.  I don\\'t answer his calls or reply to his texts.  When I go home to my local town, he always texts me and says he wants to come over and visit or that he wants to meet up.  He pretends that his actions didn\\'t completely ruin our friendship.  I demand that he holds himself accountable and changes his lifestyle.  I won\\'t respond to him until he has acknowledged how he has acted and makes an attempt to fix the problem: drinking alchohol and pretending we(closest people in his life) mean nothing to him.\\n\\nMy question:  Am I being too harsh?  Treating him like this breaks my heart.  He was my best friend, we had promised to be each other\\'s best men in our weddings.  I don\\'t know any other way for him to recognize how awful of a person he has become and to help him learn that he can\\'t live his life like this.', 'My dad is getting older, in bad shape and is too stubborn to do anything about it\\nI love my parents, but over the past 10 years my dad has been gaining weight and eating junk that has made him become pretty unhealthy.

My mother and I have been trying to get him to eat healthier and stop drinking so much, he drinks chardonnay every night and a lot of it a week. EVERY time we bring it up, he immediately diverts the topic to something else, and blames us for being negative and to be more \"positive\".

My father ended up scolding me and saying I don't value anything, and that I should stop being such an awful person, that I was one of those woman who everyone hates, just because I decided to deffend myself from her, and that SHE was the one being treated badly.

He yells at me when I deffend myself from my sister, when I told him I wasn't going to stop listening to metal he yelled at me, also when I tell him that I won't stop loving music.

I live with my mom and dad, and help take care of my grandparents.. I have fibromyalgia, chronic pain, migraines 4-5 times a week and have trouble getting out of bed some days. Brother (loses jobs frequently, can never keep his wife happy) she\\'s become a very spiteful and distant person in the last 2 years. They decided to move in March of 2016 after not getting their way of getting help from my mom (who helps everyone and is the kindest and most selfless person you will ever meet). They have 3 kids, and now a fourth one on the way in May. Brother \"Dave\" and his wife gonna call her \"Vick\". Always go back and forth at one another, as he loses jobs and they both work (she\\'s held a stable job and he hasn\\'t), calls him lazy, P.O.S., a horrible father, our family made her the way she is now, tells her kids to \"suck it or, or stop crying\" when they get upset or hurt. She used to be the sweetest, kindest person ever. I REALLY liked this woman, and we got along great. I could never say a bad thing about her 10 years ago. Until, I came out in 2008 as gay. She was supportive or so I thought. Then wrote a long nasty letter to me after telling my mom she didn\\'t want me holding my boyfriends hand around her kids, that she didn\\'t want that exposed to them, etc. I called her a hypocrite and walked off, because she did all these things with her husband and more. Nothing more, nothing less.  Cause she was and I was sick of all her bull about me and her hating on the way I was. I don\\'t say things unless something truly bothers me and I was at the last straw. \\n\\n\\nSaid she didn\\'t support me being gay, me being with my boyfriend was wrong, she doesn\\'t want her kids around it, etc. Anyway, little bits of this kept coming up over the last 9 years and slowly grew distant from her. Last one me being worried about her being mad at me for something, as she came in and didn\\'t talk  to me or respond to what I had said. I said is she mad at me? To my brother. He goes I don\\'t think so. She then yells \"I\\'m not mad, STOP BEING SO DRAMATIC!\" I\\'m like wow.. completely out of character for her. I\\'ve never done anything to her to get spoken to like this.  1 year ago -- she called my brother a piece of sh*t for the 40th time. I got tired of it, her belittling him, throwing his things, telling him that our family are horrible people for the fights we get in once every 2 months. He looked defeated, he looked the saddest I\\'ve ever seen him. I asked what was wrong, he told me. I agreed with what he had said about her letting the children use the tablets too, that it was ridiculous that she\\'s called him something so horrible over it. I was really angry at her, disappointed with her. We had gotten into a big fight after me coming out before as well and she denied everything that happened that day. \\n\\n\\nI whipped out my phone for this one -- so all the facts were here. Everything was caught on camera for the minute we got into it. After I go into my room, she comes and slams the door next to my room closed and says, \"You\\'ve got to me f\\'ing kidding me. Is he really siding with you. HELL NO!\" to my brother. I come out and say what\\'s the problem? (My mistake, but no... no one in my family has ever said anything to this woman to keep the peace. They\\'re afraid of her taking the grandchildren away and my mom loves them dearly and is afraid of having a bad relationship with her.) I say \"I\\'m tired of you calling my brother a piece of crap.\" I yelled, \"Stop treating him like that, what the hell is wrong with you? Who says that to the person they love and are married to? Why do you belittle him so much when he\\'s finally got a nice job. I can\\'t believe anyone in this house doesn\\'t say anything to you over the way you treat him, specially around your kids.

You can go.\" This sparks her sister to message me -- telling me \"Never in my life have I been so disgusted with someone. Who do you think you are filming her!? The mother of your nephew and nieces raising your voice at her telling her to get out. I\\'m so disgusted, get the F\\' outta here!\" \\n\\n\\nBrother wouldn\\'t defend her after that happened.

Saying they\\'re going to move and haven\\'t. Ever since then, she\\'s just been passive aggressive. Stands in the doorway and doesn\\'t move when I need to get through. Is constantly rude when anyone says anything to her kids (when they\\'re making a mess, yelling and telling adults to stop talking to them) unattended downstairs as she\\'s on the couch upstairs. Telling my brother that I\\'m doing things when I haven\\'t even spoken to this woman in months. I am so uncomfortable around her. I have said hi to her and things and have stopped, because it\\'s a short \"hi\" and walks by. The last 6 months she\\'s walked by me and hasn\\'t said a word, no hi, no bye when she goes out the door. Walks by me or anyone in this house aside from my mom like we\\'re not there.\\n\\nI know this sounds pathetic coming from a man who\\'s 28, but I\\'m actually sick and am developing actual dislike and almost even hate for this woman. She hogs the washer and dryer, tells me to turn my animal light off when she\\'s going to bed (cause it\\'s out where she sleeps in the upstairs loft). Tells me to get all my stuff out of there when it was my storage space and now my room is packed with all my things out there. Tells everyone to keep it down. You go down the stairs too loud (passed her) she will ask who\\'s there and make a big deal out of it. If anyone says anything to their daughters being rude to us, they both snap (yes my brother too) and call us rude, guilt trip us and say \"they\\'re 5 and 9 years old, this is the way youre going to talk to a kid!?!, or they were just trying to make a sandwich as they\\'re telling us to \"stop taking to me or telling me what to do, you\\'re not my mom or dad\" etc.\\n\\nIs it bad that I want them all to move? I\\'m in my room most days when they\\'re. I feel so trapped here, and I don\\'t know what to do. I have no choice but to stay here until I find a job for people like me with chronic health issues - and they\\'re never going to move because they constantly mooch off my mother.  She pays for their car accidents, their bills, their car rentals, their groceries, dinner, gives them money to go on dates and gas to go drive to work (even though they make their own money), etc.  My mom is starting to sort of agree she even wants them to move, and she won\\'t step up and say anything to anyone. I tell her to or else I will. She goes \"NO DON\\'T!\" She\\'s so afraid of these people -- and losing her grandkids. \\n\\nI don\\'t know what to do.', 'Is My Friend A Bad Friend?\\nI have a friend. When I moved to a foreign country, I went to a school and met this friend. We have been quite close but after I moved back to my country, weâ\\x80\\x99ve only been communicating through texts. She has been a helpful friend but I donâ\\x80\\x99t know if she is a good friend or a bad friend. \\n\\nThere were many occasions when I wondered if I should break friends with her, but I always told myself that she didnâ\\x80\\x99t mean to ever hurt me and I kept on trying my best to act like nothing was wrong and acted friendly. But I srsly canâ\\x80\\x99t hold it in and I wanna know if Iâ\\x80\\x99m just being sensitive.. \\n\\nThese are some of the things she does that makes me wonder if we should break friends..\\n\\n1.We use eachotherâ\\x80\\x99s selfies as our profile pics and I always use the best selfies of hers or at least what I think are the best looking ones. And I sent her a video if me singing with my other friend and she took a screenshot in the middle of the video and used it as her profile pic and My mouth was wide open and my eyes were scrunched up and it really looked horrible and when I asked her to change it, she asked what I meant and that it didnt look bad. \\n\\nSure she couldve been being nice and I couldâ\\x80\\x99ve been acting emotional but I really didnâ\\x80\\x99t like other people who I didnâ\\x80\\x99t even know seeing a photo like this so I pleaded her to change it but I tried to keep the joking and friendly mood. However then she said â\\x80\\x9cFunny. U wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t wanna see the other screenshot I took.â\\x80\\x9d And we both didnâ\\x80\\x99t say anything. And she didnâ\\x80\\x99t change it. \\n\\n2.The way she texts me depends on her mood. If she isnâ\\x80\\x99t feeling friendly, she barely answers my texts and replies with short answers and doesnâ\\x80\\x99t laugh at anything funny I have to say.\\n\\n I wondered if I could also be acting like that at times but I looked back at our conversations and ai never let my mood change the way I replied to her, and I honestly didnâ\\x80\\x99t even speak in an unfriendly way when she said something rude to me or something that made me feel offended.\\n\\n3.She doesnâ\\x80\\x99t act like she cares for what I have to say. Whenever something bad happens to me and I tell her, she just gives a small reaction and talks about something else.\\n\\n4.She ignores my texts. There was once a time when she saw my texts and didnt reply. I asked why she didnâ\\x80\\x99t reply and she saw it but ignored it. I thought that maybe she had something important going on so I just kept on texting her every few hours like nothing was wrong cuz I donâ\\x80\\x99t exactly like showing others when I feel hurt. \\n\\nShe read my texts and ignored me for two whole days and finally texted me back as if nothing had happened. She didnâ\\x80\\x99t apologize for not replying nor did she give an explanation. She just texted me about something else she wanted to say. There were lots of cases like this.\\n\\n5.She acts like she has the worst life. I go through alot of stress each day cuz I have had family troubles and sometimes had been bullied. I have also often had suicidal thoughts. \\n\\nHowever whenever I tell her about things that are stressing me out, she points out that her life is worse. I understand that she has her own troubles but I really dont like the way she underestimates my life and doesnâ\\x80\\x99t care for it.\\n\\n6.She once cyber bullied me. When I left her school and left the country, we had a small fight and she told her friends about the bad things I had once said, not mentioning her faults. She then invited me to a group chat with lots of people and they all fought against me, calling me fat,ugly,short,stupid,and dumb. They also made racial comments and insulted my mom. \\n\\nAfter a year passed, I texted her. I canâ\\x80\\x99t believe I did it, but I said that I WAS SORRY. And she said that she forgave me and now weâ\\x80\\x99re talking like friends again. \\n\\nBut whenever I bring up a little detail from the past, she gets mad and says that I am blaming her for the past and makes me feel guilty for something I shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t be guilty about.\\n\\n7.She thinks that she is perfectly innocent. Iâ\\x80\\x99m not saying shes a totally horrible person, she can be a good friend at times, but I gotta admit that at times she can be horrid.. \\nAnd whenever something bad happens to her, she says that she doesnâ\\x80\\x99t get what she did to deserve it and that she is getting mistreated. \\n\\nIf you think about it that way, I feel like I also deserve this, considering Im not a saint or an angel. But whenever my friend says that she didnt do anything bad to deserve some bad things that happened to her, I canâ\\x80\\x99t help but feel disappointed at the fact that she doesnâ\\x80\\x99t realize  how much she hurted me\\n\\nWhat should I do..? Am I just being sensitive..?', 'I feel like the friendship I have is fake on her behalf\\nI have known this girl for going on 7 years. I am not the type of person that has many friends, or is very sociable. I try to keep to myself and mind my own business, and donâ\\x80\\x99t care to hag out with people. We met at work, and I liked that there was so much that we had in common, almost like I could see myself in her. We became friends. However, there has been a few instances that make me question her friendship. \\nWe are both waitresses, and she would ask me how my night was and how much I made. It made me feel a bit uncomfortable, because the way she asked seemed a bit odd. If I would make more than her she would seem a little upset, if she made more, she seemed to be happy. Even now when I make more than her she says â\\x80\\x9cI hate youâ\\x80\\x9d. She says Iâ\\x80\\x99m her â\\x80\\x9cbest friendâ\\x80\\x9d and gets mad if I hang out with someone else without her knowing, tag/get tagged by other people on FB, or go places without inviting her. Although, she does all of these things as well, but I donâ\\x80\\x99t get upset or mention them.\\nWhen we started working at a different restaurant, right off the bat, there were people that didnâ\\x80\\x99t like me. These are people that are problematic, and always cause drama (which I cannot tolerate). Well, my friend knowing that these people talked behind my back, hated me, and made up rumors about me, decided to invite on them to her house! At that moment I realized that this fakeness was not just in my mind! My friend likes a lot of attention, she gets upset when she doesnâ\\x80\\x99t get it, or when I do; my friend likes to judge other peopleâ\\x80\\x99s bodyâ\\x80\\x99s (sheâ\\x80\\x99s taller 5â\\x80\\x996â\\x80\\x9d, thin); my friend sees every imperfection in others; My friend expects me to invite her out, buy her treats, bring her things to work, but she has never offered to do the same for me (although she does it for others); my friend posted 5 emojis on my fb wall on my birthday (ð\\x9f\\x98\\x98ð\\x9f\\x8e\\x89 ð\\x9f\\x8e\\x82ð\\x9f\\x91\\xadð\\x9f\\x92\\x83) I  always congratulate her and wish her well; My friend calls me her â\\x80\\x9cbestieâ\\x80\\x9d..... how real is this friendship for her?? \\n I forgot to mention that I always try to give her Christmas/birthday presents according to what she likes(mostly earrings or pretty blouses/dresses), she rarely gives me gifts (which is fine, I donâ\\x80\\x99t expect anything in return) but when she does, itâ\\x80\\x99s something that has nothing to do with me (like a size large red and blue Superman-logo hoodie. Iâ\\x80\\x99m a size small) or a random item she finds in the clearance section...', 'My mom wants to see me... naked?\\nWhew, so my parents moved to America from Korea and had my sister and I. They still stick to their homeland culture and tradition, but I\\'ve become accustomed to how things are done in America. Where kids have privacy and all.\\nMy mom has been pestering me to see me naked. She says it\\'s to size me to buy bras, but I don\\'t think so.\\nShe invades my personal privacy a lot, like butt slapping and I sometimes catch her staring at my privates. She comments on if I\\'m wearing a bra or not and I find it kind of creepy. I get that it may be normal in Korean culture, but I\\'ve asked her to stop since I feel uncomfortable. She said no, simply because she gave birth to me.\\nWhenever I\\'m changing, she barges into my room barely even a second after knocking and stares at me when I\\'m semi naked. I asked her for some privacy, after all, I\\'m almost 13, but she rejects it.\\nMy mom made plans to go to a public bathhouse, but I told her I don\\'t want to. She wants to drag me out and \"rub all the dead skin cells off my back\" but I feel like she only wants to see me naked.\\nShe recently got breast implants and keeps bragging about how she increased in size, and how she\\'s regaining her youth. I\\'m happy that she is, but now I feel like she\\'s shaming me for being flat. Hello? I\\'m 12. She tells me about how much bigger she was in comparison to other girls back then, then shows my sister her cleavage. I asked my mom if breasts define a woman, you know how she replied? Yes. If you want to fit in, yes. If you want to be able to wear todays modern clothes, yes. If you want to attract men, yes. I honestly LIKE being flat, but my mom says I\\'ll change my mind. I respect the fact that I may, but I\\'m still sort of annoyed.\\nI think she just wants to see me naked. Not as a parent, but as an inspector. I don\\'t know if it\\'s exactly normal in Asian culture, but I feel extremely uncomfortable. Any advice? Sorry if I sounded sorta whiney.\\n(Also, she sneaks into my room at night when she thinks I\\'m sleeping without a bra)', \"Why does my mom keep talking to me?\\nShe says Im not nice like I used to be. She was like the older I get the more understanding i should be. She also feels like I should seek wealth. But that's not something I want. I want personal growth and wisdom and strength. I know a lot may disagree and say money is what matters. Yes it does. But it's a tool. Also, I do dislike my mother because she messed up my head as I grew up. She always told me her issues. Parents should never tell kids their issues. I am 22 now and she feels like she can still change the way I am. But in my opinion, the first three years is what shapes most of a person. I want to move out. I want to buy a bike, a tent and a sleeping bag and leave... what do you guys think?\", 'My friend refuses to pay his 600 dollar lost wager to me. What to do? [Long text]\\nOne day, a friend and I started arguing about something. It turned into a heated but friendly discussion, and eventually we were both fed up with each other\\'s differing views, so we both proposed a wager. We then spent the rest of the day simply arguing, but without any real conclusion, we decided to actually follow through with our wager. Before making the wager, we agreed on 600 dollars, and it was 100% agreed on from both sides.\\n\\nFast forward to him losing the wager and promising to pay me within a month or so when he would get his next salary. I also felt a bit bad about winning, so I decided to call him and ask him what he would have done in the exact same situation if the roles were reversed. He said he would have taken the money. Right then and there, I decided I would also then take the money, as my friend is (or so I thought) a man of honor. During no time did I ever say I didn\\'t want the money from him.\\n\\nSome time after I won, I made a little joke on facebook along the lines of: \"When am I getting my juicy money?\" with a little meme, as it would be awkward to simply tell him to pay me. He simply said: \\n\\n\"I invested the money into [[fucking]] ethereum [[of all things he could have done]], and it rose 16%!\\n \\nI probably won\\'t pay you the money.\"\\n\\nI thought this was a joke, but later found out he was 100% serious. Of course this made me mad - not only that he wouldn\\'t pay me all of a sudden, but also that he broke the news in such an arrogant way. I then argued with him, saying he owed me the money and we agreed on it as two men who made a very serious wager, both knowing what we would get ourselves into. I know for a fact that I would have paid him the second I would have lost, and I have told him so many times. He now claims that it is too much to pay, that it doesn\\'t feel right (yet he also feels guilt) and that I am being negative and should just move on.\\n\\nI get very mad at unjustice just like this, as could very well have lost the wager. I basically took a very unnecessary risk with this wager. I\\'ve told him I can\\'t trust him anymore, but he seems to just want to move on, typing messages on Facebook like nothing has changed. He said he was sorry, but I don\\'t accept the apology as he can still do what is right: pay me the money.\\n\\nHe tried twisting this on me trying to make me look greedy, when in fact he is the one who fucking scammed his friend. What is your view on this?\\n', 'Family Problems - kicked out now moving out\\nIssue: \\nI have found myself unable to speak to my parents about anything. I have found, when I have problems, thinking  of doing something new like get a job, am sick or just news about school or just talk want to talk about everday things that I go to speak to other family members, friends, or counselors before them who I felt more comfortable with, which would then get my parents irritated, and upset  and make me even less likely to talk to them about anything because of how they reacted to me.\\n\\nThis has been going on for years \\n\\nExcept now it has gotten a lot worse.\\n\\n\\nWhen I have important things to tell them about, such as news about school ( be it grades, tuition, classes etc ) appointments, invitations to a friend\\'s wedding, or pretty much anything of that sort, I leave it to the last minute. Even thinking about telling them anything makes me feel extremely nervous - my heart speeds up and there\\'s a pressure in my chest, I tremble, get headaches . As soon as I do talk to them I panic and change the topic to ask about something else, zone out , or I can\\'t speak clearly at all.\\n\\nBecause of my inability to tell them anything  or even socialize with them has caused  us to drift far apart. I am  usually one to talk  and My parents dont strike up conversation with and if I somehow must up the courage to do so I feel like they don\\'t hear me and are quick to talk of all my shortcoming. ( My mom often talk about me negatively to her friends and y other relatives  sometimes where I can hear) Anyways It doesn\\'t go well. If they start the conversation it on a bad note . I have then avoided my family even more because of how they make me feel.  I merely  come home from school , do my chores and homework and staying  in my bedroom ad stay out of their way.\\n\\nI have to admit I am not a perfect child, I have given my share of attitude etc. But I believe that most of it was because I am couldn\\'t express how I felt or wanted to say or what I was thinking and wanted to expected them to know.\\n\\nWhile I don\\'t drugs or curse, stay out late, outright disobey the. Etc acting this is considered disrespectful to them.\\n\\nAt first,I just assumed it was a teenage phase a little bit worse than normal but I guess normal has been ruled out since I spend longs time in the bathroom to avoid them, hiding behind doors, flinching when I am talked to or even walking around different parts of the house to pretend I am doing something among other things .\\n\\nI don\\'t know why I am like this. Or how I got like this( well maybe I have some idea) but I can\\'t shake it.\\nI have been advised to \\'just go talk to them\\' but that is the very thing I cannot do!\\nI don\\'t think they understand how much pain this causes me when I have to gather my courage to even speak to them to ask for advice, and they rebuff me even now. I need some advice about how to proceed and handle this\\nI have no more courage in me, low self esteem and probably some other things.\\nI feel that my parents are not emotionally ..um supportive or open.. are so judgmental and critical I just can\\'t.\\n I\\'ve become isolating towards friends, restless at night and start eating all the time or not much at all.\\n\\n There are a  few events that I think really hurt me and thus  contributed to the problem overtime.\\n\\nexamples:\\n(Younger)\\nthey threaten to bring to boarding school and my mom even brings me to tell police station to proceed with the plan. \\n - memorable beating from incident \\n- memorable punishment of not letting me eat for a few days because I refuse to eat a seasme seed bun ( had sensitivity too, found out after) \\n- memorable punishment mom knnew I was extremely afriad of the dark made me sit in the dark in the living roomfor hours of the night.\\n- I was also left at home frequently ( with no cable , no internet) and missed out on many holiday events with family and outings. I cried a lot at first but overtime I learned to occupy myself with my own company. My mom would also leave me to clean the house as well.\\n- little \"treasured\" things like cool pencils or little toys would be taken away.i don\\'t know why but I never asked for them back, even afterwards nor would they give them back to me.\\n\\n(older)\\n- Running away to school placement\\n- struggling to secure financial assistance from my parents to help pay for my tuition. Scared the I have to drop out.\\n-threatening to donate all my work earnings\\n- and kicking me out of the house with no belongings.\\n\\nI have been torn between leaving and staying. Especially again with being cut off from my siblings as my stepdad prevent me from interacting with them after that.\\n \\nI finally left after a fight with my mom last week ( which included a rule on two day noticed before going anywhere... and talk to a worker about ending my life , which resulted her call the house concerned for my safety.

I am staying with a friend, and hoping to rent a room , get a job and go for counselling soon. \\n\\nHowever, They are now feeling bad me and are asking me to come back home ( which includes some guilt tripping- crying, using religion ( must obey parents, not put mother in hardship, will be held accountable) , younger siblings- not being able to see them, and now tell other relatives)\\n\\nI have been saying that i am not ready to comeback home ( although i am not really interested in going back, well other than being with my younger siblings whom i miss )\\n\\n I have no intention of trashing anybody, i love them, the raised me.

No judgment please??\\n6 months ago I stayed with my aunt for two weeks but I really wanted to see my cousin who Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been talking to on Facebook.  Well,  I didnâ\\x80\\x99t get to see him until like the day before I was supposed to leave and didnâ\\x80\\x99t get to speak with him as the way we were seated at our gathering Iâ\\x80\\x99d have to literally yell across the table and Iâ\\x80\\x99m not like that.   So later that night I got in an uber and went to his house around like 11 pm lmfao and I told him I was coming but he was like no and he was pissed that I didnâ\\x80\\x99t say much to him but I showed up it was raining, freezing, windy, etc and he didnâ\\x80\\x99t let me in and so I left and went back to the airport cuz I didnâ\\x80\\x99t have enough money to go all the way back to my aunts it was like 60 something miles away I only had enough to get to Newark.

I know what some of you might say but I really want to fix this??', 'Not good enough.\\nGreetings, everyone. I am currently in need of venting my thoughts. Reddit seems like the perfect environment for fucked up people, like myself. I\\'ve come for the wisdom and maybe even the charming assholes. So, here\\'s the scoop:\\n\\nGrowing up, I was always compared to a specific relative. I won\\'t say which, because I\\'m a paranoid fucker. But we shared the same gender, were of similar ages, and were always very different from each other. Still, we were extremely close. The biggest difference was our weight. Yes, I was always the \"larger\" one. People enjoyed to point it out, but what really stung was that our own family would as well. Fast forward to years later, when we were in our teenage years. It became so much more than our weight. Our family started comparing our physical appearances. They were always the more \"attractive\" one. The more \"successful\" one. We are both adults now. Our grandmother speaks wonders of this person, and only has negative things to say about me. Despite all of this, I was always deemed the \"nicer\" one. That hasn\\'t mattered a single bit. I constantly beat myself for picking up the phone when our grandmother calls, because I give her personal details of my life only for her to turn around and use it as juicy gossip material. She is very sick, and I assume quite close to death. I pick up because I feel massive guilt when I ignore her calls, while my ever-so-\"better\" relative ignores them with no problem, and is still worshipped. I\\'ve considered cutting ties with my entire family. I don\\'t believe they genuinely care about me. Yeah, I\\'m struggling. Bad. I\\'m basically at rock bottom right now. Still, I highly doubt my wellbeing is in their best interest at all. I don\\'t think I\\'ll ever be the picture perfect grandchild, child, sibling, whatever. It drowns me deep in self-loathing every day.', 'I moved 2,000 miles away for college six years ago. Parents have never visited\\nI\\'m unsure how to feel.  I moved to the other side of the country (USA) six years ago because I was accepted to a wonderful school in California.  My parents aren\\'t too wealthy but are firmly middle class.  I could not afford to trac back home because I was barely living paycheck to paycheck until recently.  I paid for everything myself - textbooks, housing, transportation.  Of course, they helped out a bit as holiday gifts, but I\\'ve never received a care package or any extra aid.  \\n\\nI am graduating next month and feel a bit sad that my parents aren\\'t even sure they want to come for my graduation or party (that I\\'m paying for myself!).  My mom said she\\'s busy with work and has to coordinate a lot.  She always says \"maybe next summer we\\'ll make a trip out there!\"  I\\'m the first person in my family to graduate college and it\\'s kinda sad that nobody in my family cares to recognize how hard it was to do this on my own.  \\n\\nI last called my dad in mid-December for his birthday.  I wanted to see how long it would take him to actually call me.  It\\'s been three months and I\\'ve not heard a word from him.  \\n\\nI was thinking about going back home this summer for a month, but am starting to question whether I should or not.  I love my life here and wish they cared enough to see it.  They have no clue what I do for work, what my degree is in, or where exactly I live.  It\\'s been six years!  My mom just bought a house so I know she\\'s at least had some money for a $300 plane ticket.  \\n\\nWhat should I do?  Visit this summer and pretend everything is fine?  Wait it out and see how long it takes one of them to call me?  Should I beg them to come to my graduation/party (I\\'ve already asked several times). I feel so awkward making up excuses for them all the time (my friends often ask when my family is coming to visit). \\n\\nThanks! ', \"Why is it that I forget information about certain people?\\n\\nToday, I've asked one of my female coworkers about what degree is she going for even though I keep asking that question when I forgot. She told me she's going for a dental bachelor. I've brought up that I've brought this up a bunch of times and she nodded.  I felt pretty embarrassed for asking that question and forgetting the answer a lot of times. (She isn't the only one though)\\n\\nI think the reason why I forget is because the front end has a tendency to have its employees to have erratic working schedules thus it doesn't help when some of the employees go to college on their days off.  I'm twenty five year old woman who doesn't go to college because I'm not too wild about school. \\n\\nI know a little bit about some of my coworkers, but I don't hang out with them outside the workplace because of many reasons. \\n\\n1.) I don't always to make the effort to build a relationship with them because I don't have a lot to say except for questions such how's your day, what time are you working til, and anything new.  I will speak when I'm spoken to.\\n\\n2.) I'm usually inside my head thinking a lot. \\n\\n3.) I look for people with similar interests. (video games, animation, internet, vaporwave, and so forth on)\\n\\n4.) I usually wait until someone talks to me.\\n\\n5.) I don't open up to people easily.\\n\\n6.) My social life is spent more online.\\n\\n7.) The interests I have aren't mainstream (video games seem to be somewhat mainstream these days)\\n\\n8.) I have autism while most of the employees don't have autism. \\n\\n9.) I don't drive due to my fear of disability limiting my ability to drive safety.\\n\\n10.) I don't talk a lot about my interests because I'm afraid I may obsess over them over and over again due to the point it may annoy co workers.\\n\\n11.) I don't usually get involved with conversations with co workers because I need to focus on my job.\\n\\n12.) When the time gets busy, I normally don't talk a lot. Again, I need focus on the job. \\n\\n13.) I come from a solitary family from my mother's side. (introversion)\\n\\n14.) I have a fear that I may say something that may offend them.\\n\\n15.) I don't always have the motivation to socialize.\\n\\n16.) I don't talk about my social life with family for reasons.\\n\\n17.) I come across as serious, thus it doesn't help that I take a lot of things seriously\\n\\n\\nI'm currently looking for free volunteer drivers in my area so I could get to places and make and keep friends.  Thankfully, I have someone at home to take me to work, but not always available to take me. Thus I can get to work by walking. (My town is somewhat walk-able)\\n\\nBack to retaining some information about co workers, I remember them I like some of the facts about them. I will put the first letter of my names of the co workers for privacy.\\n\\nExample: B is  big on cats, she has an eighteen year old daughter who used to have a pet bunny long time ago. \\nShe also love chinese as much as I do. \\n\\nC loves to play video games just like I do.  He doesn't like the customer is always right policy.\\n\\n\\nI have a fifteen minute break for every five hours I work. The breakroom tends to vary with there's no people to there's lots of people.\\n\\nSome of the co workers I know use their phone to browse on the internet while eating, and I don't want to bother them while they browse on their phone. Let's face it, it's getting tougher to socialize in real life when internet's taking over everyday life. \\n\\nTL;DR I'd like to know why I lose track of facts of particular co workers and what could I do about it.\", 'Husband in hospital and I am at a complete loss\\nHi all long time lurker first time poster. Using a throw away since it would destroy my husband if he saw this. I am on mobile and a bit sleep deprived, so sorry for the format or dreaded grammar errors. TLDR at bottom. \\n\\nHonestly I donâ\\x80\\x99t need advice I just need to let everything out now before i explode. And (un)fortunately my husband is my best friend leaving me feeling alone with no one to talk to.  I have a 20month old and am 35 weeks pregnant. My husband for the last few weeks has been feeling nauseous and out of sorts. I finally convinced him to go to a redicare. Well those jerks turned him away since they canâ\\x80\\x99t help with abdominal pain. I wasnâ\\x80\\x99t with him or they would have seen him. He ended up going to another urgent care. There they realized he had a bp of 220/112. First annoyance if the first place took his vitals we could have headed straight to the ER. We met up and got him there right away. We were at the ER for several hours before they made the decision to admit him to the cardiac unit of the hospital. Since then they have discovered a kidney issue and have not gotten a handle on the bp.  They have no answers but seem to be coming up with more questions. He isnâ\\x80\\x99t even 30 so the fact this is happening is extremely bizarre. \\n\\nHis mother was here to help, but I am at my wits end and needed to be alone this evening. We just moved our daughter to a toddler bed Saturday which is doing great at night but she hasnâ\\x80\\x99t napped in 3 days. She is crabby and obviously confused since daddy isnâ\\x80\\x99t home. She is also in a phase where hitting mommy is funny. She hit me today and I just burst into tears. Which according to my mil is my hormones which really helped the situation.  I canâ\\x80\\x99t sleep and am vomiting from pregnancy and stress. I know I have to be strong for her and him and unborn, but I am failing. I spent 2 hours tonight just crying. I keep losing my temper with my daughter. I wish I could be at the hospital with him. I feel stranded, alone and useless. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know how I can help him. He is spiraling down into a pit of depression and I have no way of helping him out. I keep calling and texting him which I can tell he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t want. \\n\\nWe are going to visit tomorrow morning then my mom is going to come here tomorrow so I can go see him again without the little one. But I havenâ\\x80\\x99t been home much the past 2 days and I know it is taking a toll on her. I just recently became a stay at home which has created separation anxiety issues. I feel torn between to 2 people who mean the world to me and I am failing both of them. \\n\\nIf you made it this far I guess the only question I have is does anyone have experience with this and how can I help him and her get through this?\\n\\n\\nTLDR: Husband has crazy high bp and hospitalized. I feel like I am failing helping him and my toddler get through this. I feel like I have no one to talk to. Being 35 weeks pregnant is not making anything easier.

I freaking loved her, but after reviewing some medical expenses we would have to pay, we had to give her back to her shelter after only a month or so of having her. I was heartbroken.\\n\\nI came back to school on Monday this week and told my friends. Now in my friend group of three, there is one guy who loves to make fun of us. One of my friends is fat so he makes fun of his weight. I\\'m gay and he makes fun of me for being a faggot. My other friend does weed and he makes fun of him for being a drug junkie.\\n\\nBut I think he crossed the line this time. He made fun of me by saying \"you killed your dog\" and all he\\'s been doing this week has been calling me a \"dog killer\" and telling everyone that I am one. The annoying part is my best friend in the group is tagging along with this joke and they both think it\\'s okay to make fun of me for this.\\n\\nI\\'m kind of embarrassed to say this, but I\\'m a very emotional person and I suffer from depression so it\\'s hard for me to deal with this kind of stuff. Today when they started making fun of me again for being a \"dog killer\" I left and hid in the bathroom cause I just wanted to cry and I did. I hate it when people are mean to each other and it really hurts when someone does it to me. That, and the fact I was really sad about Carly leaving me makes me just not want to talk to them anymore. But the problem is those guys are the only friends I really have (Trust me, they remind me I\\'d have no friends if they weren\\'t so nice to be my friend).\\n\\nI really don\\'t know what to do. I miss my dog, I\\'ve been really depressed as of recently, and my friends are making fun of me. What should I do about my friends, honestly? Because I know if I tell them \"guys stop making fun of me, I didn\\'t kill my dog\" they\\'d without a doubt say something like \"that\\'s exactly what a dog killer would say!\". I\\'ve never been able to reason with them whenever they make fun of me.\\n\\nCan anyone help me?', 'Is this my fault?\\nI\\'ve been on SSI ever since high school but before high school I wasn\\'t. My oldest aunt suggest to me to get SSI but let\\'s call her Cancer Rat because her zodiac sign is a Cancer. I was like \"Nah, I\\'m good for now\" because I\\'m lazy I didn\\'t feel like doing that but I didn\\'t tell my aunt that! SO, she took it the wrong way and start yelling BLAH, BLAH THIS and BLAH, BLAH THAT. My mom was like \"Cancer Rat you cannot get mad because she decided not to do that!\" Cancer Rat gotten more mad \"I\\'m not mad, I was just saying.\" I gotten tired of her yelling because she can\\'t get her way. I was like \"Mom, let\\'s just do it so Cancer Rat can shut the FUUUUUCK UP!\"  \\n\\nMy mom was like \"Ok, let\\'s just do it. Let\\'s get it over with.\" The thing is ever since then I was in 3rd or 4th grade the relationship between Cancer Rat and I went down hill! I stopped going to church with is where is start going down hill. She got mad because I stopped going to church with her. From time to time Cancer Rat will bring it up to manipulate me to have me feel guilty about it but I caught on to it. She makes fun of my weight, hair, clothes I wear, what I eat and drink, just everything like she\\'s overdramatic about every fucking thing I do but I\\'m probably ain\\'t the only one though. It\\'s so bad that I can\\'t even read a story on the Wattpad without her bitch ass accusing me of texting a boy when I wasn\\'t! She probably hates when I play video games. In 2016 she called me mentally retarded and said I don\\'t think straight but I don\\'t know why and if I ask her why she said that to me that she\\'ll just lie, lie, lie of why she said it. She gets overdramatic when she\\'s the last to find out shit or when you stop telling her shit, stop talking to her. I stop telling shit because you\\'ll tell her not to say anything to anyone that she\\'ll do it anyways. She did all of this ever since I was in 3rd or 4th grade and still is til this day..  \\n\\n\\nNow you know my back story with Cancer Rat. \\n\\nEver since 2014 I started to use Bitcoins and the only person knows I use it is my mom at the time but my brother started to find out and he ended up founding out. From 2014 to 2017 I will lose Bitcoins and wins or earn Bitcoins! Just like if I were to use the trade market, you\\'ll win or lose some. In 2018 I wanted to make history by making thousands of dollars from a $29.00 Bitcoin investment and I did. The problem is that Cancer Rat daughter, let\\'s call her Tuna Fish in her 30\\'s. So I made 2 mil but the household only knew about it. Until I made a big mistake by making a youtube video about my 2 mil and shared the video to my Facebook! The mistake was sharing it to my Facebook page. Here\\'s the thingâ\\x80¦Tuna Fish love to lurk on people Facebook pages using her husbands account and I wasnt paying attention until after my aunt Cancer Rat confronted me about my earnings 3 days after I shared the link to my Facebook. \\n\\nCancer Rat yell and cussed at me that accused me of using SSI money to earn my 2 mil, that I did it behind everyone\\'s back, that I didn\\'t even bother to let her help, that I was being greedy, I didn\\'t even bother to tell her, that she had heard it through someone else how they showed her proof, that the person had showed her a video of it, she\\'s disappointed in me, she will forgive but won\\'t forget, and that she feels lefted out. Here\\'s the thing I did use SSI to get the 2 mil because back in 2015 and 2016 that Cancer Rat bâ\\x80¢tch ass sent a letter to them told a false story how I barely go places, that my mom have to do all the work, that I\\'m mentally retarded, that I rage on video games, other shâ\\x80¢t that I can\\'t remember and one of the update application for SSI that Cancer Rat lied to them and said that I was in a wheel chair when I never was. \\n\\nSo that\\'s when I started to think that she might trying to get them to cut me off and thats why I used $29.00 of my SSI money to get the 2 mil as back up like I didn\\'t think it was a big deal. It wasn\\'t my fault to me because I wasn\\'t the one sending letters trying to get someone cut off but my mom told me to not say anything about the letters when we had first found out and today is day to confront Cancer Rat. I had to do it. Now Cancer Rat wants to try and tell me what to do. She says \"Girl, whatever I say to you is for the best. Whatever you did to make that 2 mil that I want you to stop doing it because it\\'s not fair that you made your first 1 mil before your 21st birthday. You didn\\'t do anything specially to get it. I mean like you SAT ON YOUR ASS!\" She was pissed but I don\\'t give a fuck.\\n\\nI said \"I had to do what I gotta do! It\\'s not my fault that it happen. The reason why I turn $29 to 2 mil is because some bitch trying to sabotage my SSI by sending in false letters and I wonder who? Now you\\'re mad because I made 2 mil before my 21st birthday OMG!\" so Cancer Rat yell and cussed at me that she said \"I KNOW YOU USED YOUR FUUUUUCKING SSI MONEY TO EARN THAT 2 MIIIIIILLLLLLLLL AND YOU USED 29 FUUUUUCKING DOLLLLLLARS! YOU DID IT BEHIND EVERYONE\\'S BAAAAAACK! YOU DIDN\\'T EVEN FUUUUUCKING BOTHER TO LET ME HELP YOUUUUUUU! YOU WAS BEING GREEEEDY! YOU DIDN\\'T EVEN FUUUUUCKING TO TELL MEEEEEEEE! I HAD TO HEAR IT THROUGH SOMEONE ELLLLLLLSE! THEY SHOWED ME PROOOOOOF! THEY SHOULD ME A VIDEO OF IIIIIIIIIIIT! I FEEL SO FUUUUUCKING LEFT OUUUUUUUUT! I\\'M SO DISAPPOINTED IN YOU GIIIIIIIIIIIIRL! I\\'LL FORGIVE BUT I WON\\'T FUUUUUCKING FORGET THIS.\" After Cancer Rat stopped yelling that I was about to say something but my mom beat me to the punch. \\n\\nMy mom said \"Cancer Rat, how is my daughter greeeeedy when you\\'re the only one complaining about the money like she didn\\'t even do anything wrong at all?\" Cancer Rat got so fucking fed up that she stopped her ass out our fucking house and slam our fâ\\x80¢cking door but while Cancer Rat and her daughter Tuna Fish was leaving that they shook their fucking heads at me!! \\n\\nAnother thing before I started to use Bitcoins that this household was very poor. Trying to make ends meet. Barely trying to keep the food in the house. What made it worse when Cancer Rat and Cancer Rat daughter Tuna Fish (Cancer Rat have 2 other sons but they always in the streets doing who knows what), Cancer Rat grandkids Mices always bragging about money, money, MONEY everytime they come over to our house. \"Look we went and bought this\", \"We went and bought that.\", \"We went and spent this much money.\", \"We went and spent that much money.\" They knew we was poor. So I asked them \"Why everytime y\\'all come over here that y\\'all somehow brag about money?\" They was like \"GIIIIIIIRL ain\\'t nobody trying to brag about money. Are you mad that you cant buy video games all the time LMFAO!!\"  Always make fun of me about that.\\n\\n\\nJune 3rd, 2018 I will be 21 years old. \\n\\nHere\\'s my question about the 2 mil and everything that â\\x9e¡Is this my fault? Am I in the wrong here because I used $29 of my SSI money to earn my 2 mil, that I did it behind everyone\\'s back apparently, that I didn\\'t even bother to let her help me apparently, that I was being greedy apparently, I didn\\'t even bother to tell her apparently? ', \"Fucked up Families- Mamas From Hell\\nWe all got that fucked up incident in our families, right? Well, Imma vent about mine, cause it real fucked. For me at least, right, so am a naive virgin eighteen year old, wanna yknow experience sex and dig a guy and stuff, so I go on the dating apps and meet a lad, real nice too, sweet and that, I obviously am attracted to him. So we date and do all the couple stuff like movies and sex and I am on cloud nine cause he an older man so like am cool at school (super super shallow and lame but yknow, naive virgin eighteen year old trying to live up to social pressures exerted by my peers). Anyway, I like the dude, and we fall for each other, we married now with kids so we chill. Right, so a month or two in, he gets all funny on a night out and makes us go somewhere quiet away from our mates, which I dont catch onto cos yknow am like shitfaced and cant feel my face so I dont realise nothing is up at all. Right so he says to me, I shagged a girl before you and am like dude thats not a surprise yknow you told me you had women before me. That shit fair enough cause hes older and yknow its normal for partners to experiment before settling for one. And he goes well I like you, a lot, and I dont want this girl to ruin shit and am like, well I dont see how you arent still shagging her are you? he isnt still shagging her right, so yknow good boy, however, he shagged her before me, like six months before me and yknow what can happen in six months? A goddamn baby can grow in the mofo womb during that time. Hes pissed, he was like I told her it was a shag, she agreed, told me she was on the pill and it mustve glitched that month (as the story always goes) and she got preggaz. I told her to terminate (dude this is a condensed version of the story, there was emotion and shit behind it, so dont go all prolife on me, it's just a minor detail im trying get out there and passed so I can tell the rest of the story). Right, so she starts kicking off saying hes emotionally black mailing her into an abortion and talking about a baby she lost as a teen and shit and am like, okay so just back off. He did, and she came back a few months later like lol theres another guy, not sure if hes the dad or not, I think its you tho. Like, good, thanks bitch, a think its you is all the proof I need. So she sends him laods of scans and basically pretends hes her baby daddy. Annoyed me a bit cos yknow i was a teen wanting to mess round and just yknow settle with this guy and this chick is trying to like worm her way in. She makes friends with his sister on fb (weird cos he doesnt have contact with any of his family, hasnt for like four years prior that) and starts getting pally with his mum dad brothers, all of them. Tells them I was his mistress and they were a couple, they decided to have a baby, and when she got pregnant he started messing round with me, a teenage girl. Fews holes in that story but well skip ahead, and the baby is born. They get this dodgy dna that says its not admissable in court due to infrequencies or something and that close relatives (she was shagging his brother at the time too) could skewer results. Basically the baby daddy could be his bro but itll come back his cause its a shit dna. Anyway it came back the baby was his and he suddenly goes all fatherly. Doesnt see the kid for like six months then starts visits and pays maintance. Meanwhile, shes fucking round going to his family and bitching about how horrible I am being a homewrecker and all that eventho they were a shag and got with him six months after her. He wont get another dna cause he was like paid for one not doing another, and I explained the issues but he wont. ALl our children look identical, the kid has blond hair and blue eyes, me and my partner are both dark and so are our kids, (the girl in question also is dark so where the fuck blond blue eyes came from is beyond me). For months after she kept ringing me saying omg you need to put him on the phone the babys sick and he needs to visit, and if you ignore it shed up it and be like an ambulance is coming now omg its serious (it never was). The kid was in hospital like twenty times in his first week of life, each time let out with nothing serious wrong, altho she exaggurated and made out he was on the brink of death. Tries to get him to take her kids out while Im in mofo labour, giving birth and shes kicking off on the phone saying hes not spending enough time with them. Once I gave birth comes round screaming and shouting how hes off the birth certificate, how shes changing the kids name and how shes taking him to court for more money yhadda yhadda yhadda.

She spoke to everyone but me, I could even see her giving her fiancÃ© looks every time I spoke- I suffer from chronic depression and anxiety so when I tried to speak to my family in the room she would speak over me about something else to that same person I was speaking to. You see, I had an abortion just months before she became pregnant and ever since then she has been off with me. She gives me looks every time I go near her son or even when I attempt to smile at her. I just don't even know anymore. Her son is 2 just to give you a reference of how long it's been.

My relationship with him, up until the dividing issue, was solid.\\n\\nI have just discovered that my best friend spent many months telling my coworkers that my relationship was illegitimate, that I was only dating him because I pitied him for his looks, and that my fiance and I were really just platonic friends but that I agreed to get married out of desperation. (To be clear, none of this is true - although others do find him to be unattractive in a conventional sense, I did not. She was projecting.) As a result, as I have now learned, my LEGITIMATE relationship became a workplace joke, and everyone has been mocking me and my fiance behind our backs for a year, including my bosses. This also includes people who I excitedly called after getting engaged and people that I had offered positions in my wedding party to. To make things worse, the fact that the relationship ended is being blamed on me being shallow about his appearance and is being used as vindication for these rumors. Not that it matters, but it ended for a plethora of deeply ingrained and painful issues, none of which were in any way related to appearance.\\n\\nI feel so betrayed by this friend that I can't imagine ever reconciling. I am preparing to completely cut her from my life and just want to know if others would do the same, or if I'm overreacting to average workplace drama.\", \"I'm sick of my parents\\nI just cant stand them anymore. They treat me like a shit compared to my sister. I never ask my parents for money I eat at home so they don't give me money for lunch I don't buy things I'm using old phone that i bought 6 years ago with my own money. But my mother changed 3 phones in the last year. They threat my sister a lot better they gifted her a phone for christmas i got some shitty speakers that had the price tag on and believe me their price was not close to the phone's. They bought her a new car last year they gave her the money for the driving lessons and she want money from them everyday. So i need a new PC at the moment so i thought that i might ask them because i really need it and that's the only thing i have ever ask my parents for my I haven't asked for a single cent in my whole life. Everything i buy i buy with my saved money from grandparents. I even buy my studentbooks with my own money. And they refused. They told me if i have the money to buy it but I spent all i had to buy furniture for my room if i didn't i would've gotten only a bed in my room. I feel hated. They don't spend time with me neither give me money. Yesterday I offered them to give me the money for the PC and when i have the money i will return them but they still said no. I legit have no idea why they do it. I don't go out often i don't argue with them  and i have decent grades in school.

To make a long story short, he got bored, and (admittedly) lied about me to them, then when he found out they didn\\'t like him as much as they liked each other, he ran back to me. I let him be my friend again, and he outed me as bi to my religious summer camp, which I then had to leave. He came back 3 months later saying he was going to therapy and he realized what he did wrong and was trying to get better, so we kept distant contact, but I found out last week he was still friends with the people he lied to (who are now gossiping about me and trying to convince my friends to end their friendships with me). I told him I was done being friends with him because he constantly endangers me or puts me in uncomfortable positions, and he called me crying about how he just wishes things were \"like they were in freshman year\" and that he \"should have never lied to them\". I hung up. He messaged me this morning asking me to meet up with our old friend group over spring break. I don\\'t know what to do.

I always invite her to hang out, I do all the cleaning, I bake her food, do sweet things, helped her when shes throwing up, taken care of her, and overall have been called an amazing roommate by others. She\\'s never once said thank you or has reciprocated, and my mother and a friend called it into my attention. I was fine with it (sort of), but I really wish she would have maybe wanted to be friends. But like I said, its fine you can\\'t force people to care back. My problem arose when I introduced her to my bestest friends because she was sad and lonely and heading down a road I was very familiar with and didn\\'t want her to go through, and she proceeded to \"Steal\" my bestest friends. I only say the world steal because she doesn\\'t try to be friends with me and talks behind my back with them and has thoroughly excluded me from my own friend group. I\\'m just so angry and can\\'t talk to her, she has permanently damaged my friendships because she literally always hangs out with them now, and has just kind of shoved me to a curb. I find it extremely inconsiderate because this year has been really rough for me because I was lowkey depressed for medical reasons and a tough break up, and she knew I was lonely and super super happy when I made my supposed close friends. She is so fake with them, it doesn\\'t make sense. For example, one of my friends was going through a rough time and I was helping him get through it, and my roommate tried to butt in and help him too after meeting him like once. Yes, reader you are probably thinking to yourself, what\\'s wrong with wanting to help people? And I would agree with you, there isn\\'t anything wrong. But the thing is that she lacks consistency. She only tries to help when it is beneficial to her. Helping people is not in her personality, I spent months and months sobbing and upset and she would just run away and turn a blind eye. Why care about my friend who I had taken the time to bond with and gained trust with? She literally had met him like twice?! I think I forgot to mention that we are both female and all my friends are male and she didn\\'t have any male friends before this and she was upset and lonely because of an ex...sounds sketchy af to me.... Point is, I haven\\'t talked to her in two weeks, I just can\\'t hang with my friends anymore, and everyone thinks I\\'m the bad guy. I myself don\\'t know if I am the bad guy, my close friends from home think I have a right to be upset..am I the bad guy for being upset? What should I even do at this point? \\nSome people told me I needed to find better friends since they don\\'t take my feelings into consideration, but I don\\'t want to be that bitch that is like you have to choose friends...I\\'m conflicted with that because loyalty in friendship is very important..idk please help I\\'m just so sad and mad ', 'How to deal with indecisive parents?\\nMy parents are unbelievably indecisive. They make every single day about making a big decision about who moves to which country and itâ\\x80\\x99s horrible. \\n\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ve lived in New Zealand for almost ten years now, and three years ago my dad moved back to the UK for work. Every single day my mother asks me if she and my brother should go back and join him, and if so where am I going to live?\\n\\nWhen I was 15 I was told we were moving to Australia. I had to report this to my dean and even had to say goodbye to all my friends, only to be told (and have to sheepishly tell my friends) it was not happening after all. Now I am 21 and it does not get any easier or less embarrassing. \\n\\nI was really excited when they promised to put me in a dorm at uni this year. I went to boarding school and loved it so I was really excited; my mum even took me to Briscoes looking for dorm equipment for me for Christâ\\x80\\x99s sake. They got me worked up like this for a good three months before telling me itâ\\x80\\x99s not going to happen after all. I mean it would have been fine if they had not got the idea in my head. \\n\\nI can not take it any more. It is mentally exhausting and I have spent the past 6-7 years feeling powerless and anxious. \\n\\nDoes anyone else have such indecisive parents? And if so how do you deal with the 24 hour stress that you find yourself in? \\n\\nSorry for the long post! ', 'Should I cut my losses &amp; move on?\\nI have a co-worker &amp; friend that Iâ\\x80\\x99ve gotten to know really well since we started working together almost 2 years ago. He seemed a bit socially awkward so I befriended him. We started hanging out &amp; we shared some pretty deep things with each other. Heâ\\x80\\x99s not big on emotions but he said he just feels comfortable talking to me about things. \\n\\nHowever, heâ\\x80\\x99s a self proclaimed â\\x80\\x9cbadâ\\x80\\x9d friend. He wants friendships on his rules, his terms &amp; there is no real sense of urgency in getting back to you.  Heâ\\x80\\x99ll not text me back for days. When I check on him he tells me I shouldnâ\\x80\\x99t worry (Iâ\\x80\\x99m a worrier by nature). He says he doesnâ\\x80\\x99t owe me anything yet tells me Iâ\\x80\\x99m one of the only people who has ever shown him unconditional love in a friend sort of way. \\n\\nOne of my biggest pet peeves is when people ignore me. Im sure he knows that &amp; he does it on purpose at times. But, I also know thatâ\\x80\\x99s just who he is based on how other co-workers talk about him at work. I can be very overbearing at times myself. I try not to be but I get really insecure about our friendship if he just ignores me; like I did something wrong to warrant being ignored??!? \\n\\nI just feel like this friendship is so up &amp; down. He has no regard for my feelings or how his actions make me feel. He thinks emotions are dumb. He says they just cause problems &amp; people get hurt. He literally almost never shows emotion in any situation. However, I have seen him cry before &amp; I know he is capable of loving someone. He claims he has no love to give because he has such a poor opinion of himself. \\n\\nIâ\\x80\\x99ve never had a friendship that has been this difficult to maintain.

I tend to get VERY passive aggressive when I am hurt. I know I will start to get that way at work toward him while he will be as polite &amp; professional as can be because thatâ\\x80\\x99s how he is. He controls his emotions SO well.

', \"Should my friend pay for the damage she caused to my car?\\nI asked my friend to drive my car and pick me and some of our other friends up from a party. She drove about 7 miles, 15 mins, with the parking brakes on. I took it to the shop the next day and they said I would be fine for now, but I would need to repair the damage within a month. They said it would be $250. \\nIf it was me I would've offered to pay 100% right away.\\nShould I ask her to pay? Should I get her insurance involved?\\nWe're both college students and she doesn't have a job.

OPs friends now know things OP originally wanted to be left in the past. \\n \\n\\n*********\\n\\n\\nMy friend (let's call him T, for now) and I had a dispute over what we classify as exposing each other. T was very drunk and gave some information I kept very personal out to my other friends and myself who were sober at the time. He mentioned the last time I got high, but he did mention how long ago. This is important because Ive had an on and off history of depression which I've been struggling with years, and I previously I used to combat it by developing a drug habit. I've been working hard to be clean for 3 years, and I've kept all this under the rug because I didn't wish to be labelled by my friends as irresponsible, or be denied respect as their friend. I buried my past and drug habits for good,  doing so brought me great happiness because this was the first thing I felt I like I myself was worth something and it let me come out of depression for a long time. He did all this because I had made a joke in this particular conversation, to which he reacted negatively, and said I ruined his reputation though my joke was not intentional to do so. Because of this, people I trust  now are asking me if I do drugs or partake in self harm because of what he said about me. Some people I'm friends with are asking me if I need counselling though I'm clean. I'm not sure if I can forgive him and it's made me feel less than a person, which is something I haven't felt in 3 years. I feel worthless again and I'm not quite sure I can mend all my friendships that probably think down upon lowest point in life. Should I cut ties with T? What should I do if now my other friends  might not see me the same way anymore?\", \"My wife wants another baby, I don't. Are we headed for divorce?\\nHi all,  I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this so let me know if it's not.  The title pretty much is why I'm here but let me give you some background.  \\n\\nMy wife and I dated for about a year before she got pregnant.  We quickly got married and had our first girl in 2005.  In 2008 we had our son, followed by our third, another girl, in 2009.  We were crazy busy for a while there and things finally calmed down a few years ago.  We made up for that by deciding that we should move to a nicer area.  We live in Vancouver where property costs a fortune.  To afford that, my wife had to go back to work full time.  She had been working 3 days a week.  She is a teacher so she still gets the summers, Christmas and spring break at home with the kids.  She kind of half joked about having a fourth child before the move but when we moved it was clear that we couldn't afford another baby.\\n\\nNow we've been in our new home for about 1.5 years.  The kids have made new friends, settled into their new school and sports teams.  Our oldest will be heading to high school next year.\\n\\nNow my wife wants a new baby.  She is obsessed with it.  It's all she thinks about and all she talks about.  She says the kids are getting older and they're not going to need her soon and she's getting depressed about it.  Every couple weeks it boils over and we fight or she bursts into tears again.\\n\\nI don't want another baby.  Our youngest is 8, our oldest is 12.  I don't want to go back there.  I've moved on from the baby stage and I love where we're at right now.  We are crazy busy with sports and activities most of the year (hockey x2, baseball x3, swimming, art class, etc....).  I am happy where we are, I don't feel like anything is missing, there's no hole in my life.\\n\\nIf we were to have another baby, we'd have to move again.  Change the kids schools again.  Have the kids meet new friends again and join new sports teams again.  I don't want to do that to them.  I've also been carrying the financial burden for the last 12 years as my wife had finally give back to work full time.  I'm not saying she wasn't working at home taking care of the kids, she was.  I am saying that if we missed a mortgage payment, that was on me and it's stressful and it's nice to have some sort on that department once again.\\n\\nI don't really know what to do, I'm afraid we're headed for a divorce but that's the last thing I want.  Should I have a baby so she won't divorce me?  What if we're in the same spot eight years from now when the baby starts to grow up a bit.  I asked her if she would go speak to a counselor with me but she says it won't change her mind that she wants another baby.\", \"Made grandma feel old XD\\nSetting of this story is morbid but this is my favorite memory with my grammy.\\n\\nI'm about to turn 22 and this took place back in November of 2017. My family lives all along Western Washington and we don't see each other often, so it was bittersweet to see everyone at my great grandmothers funeral. My cousins and I sat together at one end of the table when we all went to lunch after at a fancy restaurant with our moms next and then grandparents. Only two of us kids are old enough to drink, me and my 28 year old cousin. No one blinked an eye when he ordered an Irish coffee. But then the baby (me) ordered a rum and coke.\\n\\nThis resulted in two things.\\n1. My mom and cousin laughing at me because my original order was for Southern Comfort and coke and they said I drink  poor people booze (I'm 21 fresh out of college what do you expect)\\n2. My grandmother nearly had a heart attack when she even heard me utter that I wanted alcohol.\\n\\nWhat made this even funnier was when I got my drink and she mentioned to my mom how she keeps forgetting I'm not 16 anymore.\", 'Friend threatened to ruin my therapists life over a joke.\\nOK so I had a bit of a blur of boundaries with my therapist. It wasn\\'t a big deal. Therapy ended and we became kind of distant friends who still chat via phone calls and texting.\\n\\nHowever I told my friend that my therapist fancied me etc whilst things were happening. I told her to promise to keep it a secret even if I died. Nothing happened between me and my therapist and we never slept together, but things were a bit... Weird i guess. Some of the stuff my therapist said could make her lose her job.\\n\\nAnyway I pranked my friend today by photoshopping a fake conversation between me and my college tutor. In the convo I told them my friend referred to him as \"daddy nick\" behind his back. It was merely a joke and I didn\\'t really message the tutor any of this.\\n\\nShe freaked out when I sent her the photoshopped convo. And her immediate response was: \"I\\'m going to ruin your therapists life for this!\" I told her it was a joke and a prank. She demanded evidence which i gave her... She then acted as though things were fine when they weren\\'t.\\n\\nShe said if I ever do anything like that again she\\'ll ruin my therapists life. I feel as though she is basically at this point a bomb waiting to go off. She then asked me how my rabbit is doing??? Like I want to speak to her now???\\n\\n\\nAm I doing the right thing for wanting to ignore her and even removing her from my life?', \"Best friend of 12 years seems to be drifting\\nWhen we were in middle/high school we were inseparable. I thought she was the most amazing person to ever walk the planet. She made me feel so smart, beautiful, special, etc...I loved her so much. We went through everything together during those times and when college came around, we went to different schools. I had to work 2 jobs to keep my head above water and couldn't always make the 4-hour drive to see her as often as I wanted. She also got into drugs, which was no issue with me, but since I was never into it, I stopped getting invites to places with her (probably due to the fact I always was ALWAYS working.) We both drifted a bit in college, but then afterward we (and our SO's) moved to the same city. I was so excited to finally have a better schedule and see her as often as I could. I told her how I found God after struggling with depression and anxiety and she immediately accused me of being homophobic because I said I was Christian (born again I guess, we both grew up Catholic). Which was severely not the case. She also accused me of being so different that it's like she doesn't even know who I am anymore. I let her vent about the drifting and the differences we both grew into since middle/ high school, without even mentioning to her that she was different too, it's called growing and changing as you age, but I still loved her just the same...then I expressed how I don't want to lose her over this and we eventually squashed the beef. I know she doesn't like my boyfriend of 5 years all that much, mainly because she thinks he changed me, not taking into account that I can make my own decisions and have my own thoughts that that nothing to do with my boyfriend's. 2 years go by and during those two years, her father passes away unexpectedly. He was the light in her life and it was so painful to see everything she went through during that time. I was there for her as often as she needed me and then some. Eventually, things started to feel really one-sided. I kept ignoring it because I knew she was grieving, but after almost 2 years, it was starting to get to me. My calls and texts were hardly received, she always seemed to be in a rush to talk to me, it felt like walking on eggshells. I guess now, what really bothers me is that a friend of hers is going through a hard time with her SO and my best friend has been extremely supportive and just going above and beyond with this other girl, while all I feel like I've received from her is criticism of my relationship, my values, my political views (which she really knows almost nothing about but assumes my position). As I write this, I'm actually getting angry at how much I've been there for her, but how little she has been there for me. I'm extremely scared to bring all this up to her because she is so critical and everything she says cuts deep. It's not a good feeling, but neither is this. I don't really know what to do, and I can't imagine losing her. I would hope I can work up the confidence to tell her how I'm feeling and we can have a rational conversation about it. But I just feel really stuck. \", 'Is it normal for a dad to say this to his daughter?\\nSorry if this isnâ\\x80\\x99t the right sub. Just need an outsiders opinion on this issue. My dad will often make *jokes* about my weight, for example: Tonight we were having dessert and I didnâ\\x80\\x99t want any, he told me to stuff it in my fat little face. A few days ago, I was eating chips and he said Iâ\\x80\\x99m gonna get chubby, before that, he says stuff like â\\x80\\x9cNobody likes the fat chickâ\\x80\\x9d He says Iâ\\x80\\x99m gonna â\\x80\\x9cget fat like my mom when Iâ\\x80\\x99m olderâ\\x80\\x9d thatâ\\x80\\x99s another thing, my parents are divorced due to my mom cheating and if Iâ\\x80\\x99m being sarcastic towards him or anything he says â\\x80\\x9cIâ\\x80\\x99m gonna give you to your mom if youâ\\x80\\x99re not careful.â\\x80\\x9d Itâ\\x80\\x99s like Iâ\\x80\\x99m an object instead of a person?

Heâ\\x80\\x99s a great dad besides the comments he makes here and there. I got pretty upset by the comment he made tonight cause Iâ\\x80\\x99ve been dealing with weight issues and self esteem. He didnâ\\x80\\x99t understand why I got upset cause itâ\\x80\\x99s a joke to him. I dunno, am I being overly sensitive?', 'Questioning the legitimacy of a friendship (very long post)\\nAlrighty. Buckle up, because this post is going to be long. There\\'s gonna be a lot of information tossed at you, so if you\\'re feeling like demolishing a massive wall of text, read on.\\n\\nA couple years back, I got my first real job. It was great. The people, the work, everything. I become friends with a waitress, which is kind of usual seeing as I\\'ve never been able to make friends with a woman before and she\\'s a bit older than me, but that\\'s beside the point. We hit it off as soon as we start working shifts together and talked constantly. She\\'d occasionally ask me to come out to eat with her, and on a couple occasions we did and both had a great time (as far as I could tell anyway). She\\'d also suggest that her and I should get together sometime and hang out with another waitress that\\'s she\\'s friends with.\\n\\nA few months in, my parents discover my friendship with the waitress and immediately assume the worst, e.g. I\\'m only friends with her for sex/drugs/alcohol, all of which aren\\'t true. They couldn\\'t seem to grasp that we could be just friends despite the age gap. They eventually believe that I\\'m telling them the truth, but not before one of them calls my boss and tells him that the waitress and I are \"dating\" but I\\'m too stupid to know it. This puts her in some hot water and she tells me about it the next day. My parents continue bothering me about the friendship with my coworker. \\n\\nIn spite of this, nothing changes between the waitress and I. We still have a great time talking to each other, and I even stay at work for hours after my shift ends to talk with her. Two weeks after my parents find out about my workplace friendship, I turn 18. Suddenly my parents don\\'t care about who I\\'m friends with anymore, saying that I can make my own choices now. I tell my friend that she doesn\\'t have to worry about my parents being involved anymore, and life is good. She also tells me that she\\'s looking for a roommate, and asks me if I\\'m interested. Over the course of the next six months, she makes several more offers to hang out with me and her waitress friend, only it never happens. The dates never get nailed down, or I just never hear back from her after I express interest. I chalk it up to forgetfulness or a busy schedule and leave it alone. \\n\\nThanksgiving rolls around. I tell my friend that due to pressure from my parents, I\\'m going to have to quit working and find a full time job. She\\'s sad at first but is still determined to spend time with me despite the fact that I\\'m quitting. I start my new job and hear nothing from her over the course of two months. This isn\\'t unusual, seeing as we never communicated outside of work before, but I think it\\'s a little strange considering that she was so determined to spend time with me when I said I was quitting.\\n\\nI stop by work on my day off and she nearly knocks me over when she comes to give me a hug. This is completely unexpected by me because even though we talked a hell of a lot, we never really had any physical contact. She tells me how much she\\'s missed me and had no one else to talk to, and if I\\'m going to the Christmas party at the end of the month. I hang around for a few hours while we chat and leave when she goes to her other job. Later that night, she texts me saying that it how it was so nice to see me and that she\\'s going to the Christmas party and hopes to see me there.\\n\\nI go to the Christmas party and we have a great time playing games and cards and eating shitty pizza. We both decide to leave at the same time and she gives me a ride home along with a couple other coworkers. We don\\'t talk again at all until she texts me at work a  month later asking if she can borrow some money. I leave and come give her the money, thinking that it\\'s kind of weird that we\\'ve been friends for over a year and I\\'m just now seeing what her house looks like. We talk for way too long considering that I\\'m supposed to be at work, but enjoy ourselves anyway.\\n\\nLater that week, I stop at work on my day off and talk to her for a while before leaving for unrelated reasons. Another month passes with no communication before I stop to see her again, and this time she hardly notices I\\'m there. The only time that she says something to me is when I outright ask her how she\\'s been, and even then the conversation is uncharacteristically brief. I wonder if there\\'s something on her mind that she\\'s not telling me, seeing as that would explain why she seems so quiet. I decide to not bother and leave her alone.\\n\\nThat weekend I show up to her work after being asked to fill in for someone. Seeing as I had nothing better to do, I take the offer. Unlike last time I was there, my friend seems to be acting like her normal self. We talk for a bit while I work and I go up front to hang around. She tells me that she\\'s going to go home and watch a movie and was wondering if I\\'d like to swing by after work. I tell her I\\'d love to and wait for her to call me like she said she would. I never get the call. \\n\\nThat was a couple weeks ago.  I just can\\'t help but feel like all of these offers to spend time with her aren\\'t legitimate offers but rather her faking interest in spending time with me. I wish that there was some way that I could tell her this without coming off as uncaring or needy, but I just don\\'t feel like there\\'s a way to tell her this without coming off as an asshole in one way or another.\\n\\nThanks to those that read this or answer. This has been on my mind a lot as of late and it feels good to get it off of my chest.', 'Is my sister (31) a toxic person, am I (28m) overreacting? Should i confront her or should i talk to a specialist for a peace of mind?\\nHello, 28 male. I\\'ll try to be as brief as possible. I\\'ve never been very close with my sister. We talk and communicate and help each other (lately I\\'m the one helping) but I\\'ve never really... connected with her. In a few words - if she wasn\\'t my sister I would\\'ve never consider her a friend or someone worth keeping close to me. As a child she was very abusive (maybe not the best word) in terms of getting what she wanted - tantrums, fights, screaming, being the centre of attention - you name it. Later on in her teen years she had constant fights with our parents over staying late at parties and so on. She was grounded more than a handful of times during that period. Over the years her attitude stayed the same. She has no qualms about burning bridges with people. Friends, family - you name it. If she gets in a fight with someone she would never stop and think twice before saying something that she may regret later on. Like an animal that\\'s being threatened - bite, bite, bite. This would often lead to tentions in our family as she and the other party won\\'t speak for couple of weeks. She has a child now (1.5y.o.) and the poor kid is truning out to be a real brat. We would go over to her house and the kid is throwing tantrums all over the place. She says \"well, he wants to sleep\" but won\\'t go to the other room with him. In the meantime the kid is touching the food, throwing forks and we are all trying to keep all the food, beverages, our phones and what not away from him and she would say somehthing like: \"well, yea, the fun of being a parent. You\\'ll see when you have one, ha ha\". Such a fun. And she is really obsessive. She\\'s the one that does the talking. At this point I know everything about pregnancy, childbirth, brestfeeding, nutrition, whats good and whats bad for the kid. She and the kid are in every conversation. Some one would say \"I didn\\'t get to clean the house this weekend\". Well guess what? She didn\\'t get to clean the house too, because of the kid. \"Wow, house cleaning... Yeah, haven\\'t done that in a while now. But you really can\\'t, once you have a kid. You\\'ll see\". She is lacking friends and communication, I can tell. All she talks about is some Facebook groups with other mothers that we don\\'t know. We have never heard of them, we are not bothered to but here we are - we know about some random mom and her kid\\'s sleep schedule, eating habits, inside jokes we don\\'t really appreciate or care to. And if its not her and the kid in the centre of attention its her and my BIL fighting over stupid, stupid shit that I don\\'t want to hear or know about. And its not only me - my gf, our parents, mutual friends and so on. We are so deep in that shit, that some of our mutual friends are making excuses to avoid them. And my sister\\'s answer? \"Oh, they\\'ll see! Things are gonna change between us and them. I\\'ll see them when they have a kid\" We (me and my GF) are avoiding them too, as much as possible! But if you confront her you better be ready to go to war. She can\\'t handle critisism. To her this means a fight. And if  get in a fight with her you better be ready for a throwdown and to hear some bad shit about yourself. Thruth is I don\\'t want to confront her to spare my self all the drama. The yelling, the tantrums, her playing the victim how hard it is, seeking support and involving my mother for example.... It probably is hard. Sure is. But after more than six months of me helping them with their house renovation, using my car as a truck or taxi, depending on what they need (building materials, groceries, doctor appointments etc you name it) I\\'m kinda sick of it and lost! I really can\\'t tell - am i overreacting over this? If not - should I confront her and hope that she will take my criticism as an adult. I\\'m really thinking of seeing a specialist seeking an advices and peace of mind. \\nSorry for the rant! Your input is much appreciated!', 'Friend Abandonment Issues\\nHey Reddit. Im having some friend issues. I(M33) have a friend(M34) who I was close with for years who now seems to abandoning me. We met each other 10 years ago. We hit it off and would casually hang out with eachother. He was new to the city so I ushered him into the fold of my friend group.We both had similar tastes and sense of humor. It would work out good and we would have a great time. After a couple years he totally cut off contact with me and those friends. I was confused but didn\\'t mind so much then because I wasn\\'t super close with him. I was confused but not hurt. A couple years after that I reached out to a bunch of people because I needed help moving. I was pretty desperate and couldn\\'t afford movers so I reached out to him as well. To my surprise he responded and came and helped. I was so happy he offered to help and was happy to see him again. After that, we started hanging out again. I asked him what happened and why he broke off contact and he shared with me things about being depressed and hanging out with other people. It felt I little strange but I accepted it and carried on being his friend again. We both moved to a \\'big city\\' through our jobs and work and would meet lots of different people and introduce each other to new friends. We would periodically check in with each other and see how each other are doing, even if we couldn\\'t hang out for weeks on end. We were in a band for a while, threw parties and events. We both went through break ups with our long time partners at different times, and helped each other out in that regard. We basically became \\'close friends\\' and expressed this to each other. Then I introduced him to a group of old friends of mine who recently moved into the city. They all began to hang out with him and it was all good. He even hooked up with one of those friends and have been together for years. I too found a partner I have been with for a a couple years now.\\nNow, over the past couple years he has began to hang out with all of those friends and much less of me. He hardly ever reaches out to catch up or hang out. Months will go by. I try to reach out and stay in touch with him but he does not reciprocate. I had been dealing with this over the past couple years now. I finally called him that I feel a little hurt and that it feels like he doesn\\'t reach out or try to stay in touch- or care for that matter. His response is \"I\\'m just too busy\" sort of answer. I can also see on social media that he does hang out with other people- mostly the friends I\\'ve introduced him to. I feel really hurt by this. I don\\'t understand why he all the sudden doesn\\'t seem to care about me. I don\\'t feel like I have any good friends I can go to anymore. Other close friends have done the same. I have had other friends that I became pretty close with who later I feel like started to treat me like they were \\'too cool\\' to hang out with me anymore. I start to feel less respected and cared about. I\\'ll ask them about things they\\'re doing in their lives and won\\'t be asked the same questions in return. When I do put forward information about things is my life I feel like they\\'re less and less taken seriously or completely indifferent to it.\\nHere\\'s the other thing that confuses me: Some of these friends years later come out of the blue- if I run into them or they start commenting a ton on fb post and act like nothing happened and sometimes they are eager to hang out again. It makes me feel like all the sudden I\\'ve done something cool enough, or are hanging out with people they are interested in and want to join in. I don\\'t know whether to ignore them or try to let things go and be friends. My fear is that if I do, we may become close again and they will just do the same thing.\\nIm very confused why this happens. I don\\'t know if I\\'m doing something to encourage this. When I say \\'close friend\\' I do not mean calling every day or even every week and sharing every aspect of each other lives. Close friend just means some one you can talk to every once in a while, and who checks in to see how the other is doing. Is that asking for too much? I feel envious when I see how my girlfriend has couple good friends she talks to about her life and issues. I think it\\'s healthy to have close friends other than your significant other you can do this with, I just don\\'t understand why I can\\'t hold close friends. Any advice would be welcomed.\\nAs a side note: since this has happened with my \\'close friend\\' I have tried to widen my net and reach out to other people to hang out. I am becoming extremely exhausted. At age 33 now, I feel it is so difficult to try to hang out with other people. I feel like I do all the reaching out and it\\'s making me feel extremely bitter about friends and relationships. I understand about casual friends, networking, or friends that are united around similar interests. I just get frustrated when that is the only thing that holds people together. I wonder- is that a symptom of living in a big city where everyone is trying to \\'make it?\\' I think that, but then I\\'ll hear about how some other casual friends keep in touch with each other still and give each other life advice etc. and just feel frustrated that I can\\'t keep consistent good friends like that. What am I doing wrong?', \"What's wrong with my dad and what should I do about him?\\n(sorry for the long post)\\nI wasn't sure where to post this, so I just put it under r/family.\\nA bit of background info: My parents have been divorced since I was 4.\\nFor as long as I can remember, my dad's been threatening the things I like to keep me in line. When I was 5 or 6, I had a pet bird that he often threatened to kill or release into the wild if I didn't play the piano. These days, he threatens to sell my phone and my computer (which he knows I need for homework) when I don't attend swim practice at a club I've been going to for years. He's also tried to use me to threaten my mom by refusing to pay for my braces (which cost about $5000) because her arthritis has been preventing her from taking me to swim practice. Not to mention she's unemployed. He's also said some pretty hurtful things about both of us when he's gotten mad. He called me egotistic and has told me a couple of times that he no longer looks forward to picking me up from my mom's house, and he's called my mom negative and accused her of not putting in the effort to give me a good childhood. He often tries to guilt-trip me when I piss him off, usually by telling me about how much effort he puts into raising me and how he does everything while I waste my time on my computer. There was a point back in 6th and 7th grade when he was pretty much a textbook case of emotional abuse, but he's improved since then and it gave me hope that he'd stop the threats and angry rants. Also, he rarely goes through with his threats, although that doesn't make them any less hurtful. Besides the threats and somewhat frequent outbursts, he's a generally normal parent.\\nI can get my mom to file for a full transfer of custody, but I'm afraid she can't handle the financial burden of having me full-time. I'm also a little suspicious of her because I remember her hitting me before my parents divorced, even though she denies it. However, she's a much better parent than my dad right now.\\nSo my questions are: Should I consider my dad abusive? Should I take action?\", 'Is this my distorted reality?\\nOkay, I almost always run into this problem with friends, and I\\'m not sure how to get out of the situation without feeling guilty or ashamed of losing yet another friend.\\n\\nSituation One\\nThere\\'s this friend whom I helped many times and every single time other people bashed me, she would either laughed with other people or further ridicule me.  Things like asking me to fix her phone, helping her find a place to rent, providing her with advice on many issues...\\n\\nI have since asked her not to further ridicule me, and her response was, \"oh this is not what I do, but I would like to remain friends with you because you are a resourceful person and you see things differently.\" I kind of ghosted her after I graduated from university, but I always wondered whether I handled the situation appropriately.  She always tries to avoid me in public space, but when she gets into a car accident, she would call me and ask for help.  I am neither interested nor in love with her.  I actually felt she might be in a hopeless state, that\\'s why she wanted my help.  \\n\\nSCENARIO TWO\\nI have this friend who always makes weird implication towards how stingy I am.  They made assumptions about my contributions to me and my SO and said things like, \"Oh, if given the opportunity, would you kill [so\\'s name] and claim his insurance policy\", \"You know greedy people normally turn out to be the poorest bunch in the population right?\".  The fact is, I have been contributing to the relationship between my SO, my SO is older than me, so in a way, my SO is more financially independent.  At times when SO is helping me out, I always mark the number down so I know how much I owe SO [actually he calculated the amount and sends me invoices].  But I won\\'t disclose such details to my friends.  I am just disappointed as to how people assume things and the last thing I want is to be the victim in every f*ing relationship.\\n\\nIs there something I am not seeing here, is there a problem with how I am handling the situation well?', 'I dropped an internet friend several months ago and I regret it.\\nI met her like almost 3 years ago. We were very close internet friends and would talk basically every day. She was amazing. In real life i had basically no friends. She was the only friend I had. I\\'m sure this led me to having unhealthy views on relationships. I still have unhealthy habits and feelings towards relationships. Anyways, the trouble began when on instagram, our main chatting platform, she began to gain friends from just common interests and such. She started posting screenshots of her friends and her dm conversations and how funny they were. She then would post screenshots of her group chat conversations and how funny they were. All of this would happen, and I would still be waiting for a simple reply. I didn\\'t get it. I still don\\'t really get it. I was there for her for so long. She didn\\'t have many friends in real life or online either. But once she had gotten these new internet friends she would ignore me? She would reply up to three or four days later. She also made a whole separate account where she would post as well which she never even told me about and I had to find out myself when she spoke about it on her main account. I finally had enough and sent her a long explanation about my feelings and stuff and didn\\'t speak to her after that. And the funny thing is that she didn\\'t reply to my explanation for two weeks. And suddenly she was like \":( nooo pls :((\" etc\\nTyping all of this, I lowkey am getting annoyed..\\nI just want someone to smack some sense into me. Like it\\'s been so long and I still think about her. It wasn\\'t like she was a bad friend, but she just fuckin ignored me and basically left me. \\nI usually think about her when I\\'m feeling lonely or my irl best friend starts to treat me like shit and ignores me.. but that\\'s a different story...\\nRight now, I\\'m thinking about dming her and just having small talk. I feel like it\\'s a bad idea, but also it could reunite us and we could be friends again? \\nIt\\'s probably a bad idea and I probably won\\'t do it though..\\nPlease give me words of wisdom.', 'Friend dumps problems on me and thatâ\\x80\\x99s all we do together now\\nInterested in other peoples experience of this and suggestions!\\n\\nHave been friends with a woman for a few years.  Started off fun, weâ\\x80\\x99d go for lunch, gigs and talk about a whole range of topics in person and by text. \\n\\nFor the last 6 months sheâ\\x80\\x99s stopped meeting up with me and responding to messages (or sending any). Instead she calls me at least once every week for often 2 - 3 hours asking for advice about men, her job and other stresses. Sheâ\\x80\\x99ll talk for over 20 mins uninterrupted, wonâ\\x80\\x99t stop talking when I need to go and will call even if Iâ\\x80\\x99ve said Iâ\\x80\\x99ll be out or unavailable. \\n\\nI got married oversees recently and our conversation was 10 mins on this and the remaining 2 hours about her problems. \\n\\nShe gets aggressive if I donâ\\x80\\x99t offer a solution but when I cave and suggest another way of looking at things she throws it back in my face. She will often cite conversations with others where sheâ\\x80\\x99s gotten into an argument, and for hours will push me to give an opinion as to what she did wrong and when I diplomatically suggest doing something different or how maybe the other person didnâ\\x80\\x99t mean it how it came across she will say I donâ\\x80\\x99t defend her and make passive aggressive remarks. Sheâ\\x80\\x99ll ask me to make decisions and then complains of it doesnâ\\x80\\x99t give her the result she wanted!\\n\\nItâ\\x80\\x99s confusing and really draining.

In fact I moved House once and she complained she had withdrawals from our calls. \\n\\nFeel pretty used as she has little to no consideration of my feelings or boundaries. In fact once on a call with her I received a text saying my grandmother had died, she just said she had to go and never mentioned it again, not even to ask how I was doing. \\n\\nWould you say anything or just cut ties given how sensitive she seems?', 'Hosted my sisterâ\\x80\\x99s baby shower, only to be a second thought the next day\\nHi Reddit! Iâ\\x80\\x99m wondering if Iâ\\x80\\x99m being too emotional about this and could use your opinion. I flew from Utah to Boston and arrived Thursday morning on a red eye. From 6am Thursday to 3am Saturday, my mom and I prepped for my sisters baby shower. I see her once or twice a year, but the three of us talk almost everyday on a group chat, and weâ\\x80\\x99re close. My mom and I stopped prepping briefly Friday night to meet her, her husband, and her best friend (who flew in that night) for dinner- so that was the first time I was seeing her this trip, same as her friend. The best friend stayed at her house while I was staying with my mom.\\n\\nSo Saturday we had the shower for 25 people. Huge hit. Sister was very very appreciative and loved it. I had brought my suitcase in the event I slept over there, so I could have more time with her Sunday morning. This is generally normal. Once the shower wrapped, her friend brought my suitcase down...sort of a â\\x80\\x9chere you go, bye.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe main Sunday plan was to watch the AFC game back at her house, at 3pm. I woke up after some major sleep catch up at 10:30 and asked the mom/sister group text, â\\x80\\x9cwhat should we do today kids??â\\x80\\x9d To which my sister replied that her and her girlfriend are getting breakfast and meeting up with the girlfriendâ\\x80\\x99s husbandâ\\x80\\x99s cousin (who also lives in Boston) and that theyâ\\x80\\x99d be back at the house at 2:30 before the game. \\n\\nMy flight back to Utah is 6am Monday, so today (Sunday) was really the only time to see her.\\n\\nI didnâ\\x80\\x99t respond to that message. Around 1pm I told my mom that I didnâ\\x80\\x99t want to watch the game with them, and Iâ\\x80\\x99d rather go downtown and watch it in a bar since I was feeling extremely hurt after putting all that work in for her shower, and then feel like an after thought the next day. So, Mom and I went to a bar and watched it.\\n\\nSister and her husband blew up at me for being so â\\x80\\x9cselfishâ\\x80\\x9d and are not talking to me. Husband went so far as to say Iâ\\x80\\x99m not welcome to see the baby when he comes. Crazy.\\n\\nI guess I should have put a smile on my face and just showed up for the game at 3? I would have if I ever stopped crying. \\n\\nThoughts?? ', 'How I Learned About My Birthfather... &amp; My Brother?\\nI remember when I was around 11, my little cousin, Lily, who was 6, came from Cuba to the U.S. with her parents. They stayed in our home for a few months until they were able to find a place. \\n\\nRight before they left for their new home; I was on my computer, I was 12, playing educational computer games. My family is chattering/gossiping in the living room per usual. I never had any interest in the family gossip, I just wanted to be in my own little space/world. Lily was not like that at all, she loved to listen-in on family drama. It was not long until Lily came barging into the room saying:    \\n\"I know a secret.\"    \\n\"What?\"    \\n\"Roberto isn\\'t your real dad.\"    \\n\"Liar.\"    \\n\"I\\'m not lying, they\\'re talking about it!\"    \\n\"I don\\'t believe you, so just leave me alone.\"    \\n\"Just ask your mom.\"\\n\\nAfter that she left the room and the seed of doubt was planted in my head. I did not think twice of it at that moment. It sure as hell bothered the hell out of me for days.. then weeks.. and eventually to months, to almost a year.\\n\\nIt wasn\\'t long after, I started to doubt it myself. I did not really look like my father, Roberto. He was light-medium brown skin color, I had pale skin with freckles. My mother had a light tan. Things that I did not notice before started to bother me. The difference in skin color, I did not have his last name, there were not baby pictures of him holding me. I did not feel a connection to this man. I was 13, almost 14, when I decided to confront my mom about it while she was organizing important documents. There was something about this that was bugged me was that... I KNEW the answer to her question BEFORE she could respond. I was 99.9% sure already, but I still had that 0.1% in order to fully believe it.    \\n\"Mom, can I ask you something?\"    \\n\"What?\"    \\n\"Is Roberto my real dad?\"    \\n\"No.\"    \\n\"Who is?\"    \\n\"I can\\'t talk right now, I\\'m busy.\"    \\n\\nIt was at that moment that I knew she did not really care to talk about it. Of course, I would bring it up again and she would brush it off just the same. \"I\\'m busy,\" or \"Not right now.\" After a while, I stopped communicating with my mother and our relationship has suffered, to this day, because of it. It was not long after my mother asked for a divorce to my step-father. I remember her sitting me down on the couch and talking to me through it. I did not have a strong relationship with Roberto to begin with, it hurt to an extent, but it was not something that I felt devastated over. She did end up telling me that she married Roberto to provide me a father figure.  \\n\\nOn my 14th birthday, Roberto tells my mother and aunt that we need to leave the house permanently. The day after my birthday, we packed up our things the same day and left. All of this happened one week before school started, I was going to start high school. It was hard for the first few months, and around that time I started to get more curious about my birthfather as Roberto was separating himself from the picture. So I began to research him, ask my mother (always backfires on me), and listening to family gossip. One of the few things I caught was that my mother came into the U.S. legally, unknowingly pregnant. When she began to go see the doctors for a check-up, that is when she found out she was pregnant. Got married to my step-father, Roberto, when I was 2yrs, and from there I believed he was my father all along up until I asked her.\\n\\nOn April 20th, 2017 I received a random friend request on Facebook. The last name was exactly like my last name and strangely enough, looking at this guy\\'s profile picture, he looked a lot like me -- strange. It took me a few days of speculation to finally grow the balls to accept the friend request after 6 days, April 25th.    \\n\"May I ask who you are? And do you have any relationship to Alexander?\"    \\n\"I am his son. From what I see, you\\'re my sister.\"    \\nFrom there he asked for my phone number. I was still skeptical and asked for details such as my birthfather\\'s birthday and my mother\\'s name to prove it. Once it was proven, I gave him me information. I found out I had a little brother in Cuba, he turned just 19 this year in January. My birthfather and his family were in Cuba. My brother 3Â½ yrs younger than me. It is absolutely crazy thinking how I was raised as an only child, while he was raised knowing I existed somewhere in the world. I still have trouble wrapping my head around this.\\n\\nI video chatted with my birthfather, Alexander, and brother, Lazaro, for hours. My father was crying. I did not get the full details on HOW they found me, it was hard to understand -- the Internet connection was extremely bad and it costs a lot of money to communicate from Cuba to the United States. I saw my grandparents for the first time. My grandfather was crying on the webcam and my grandmother was crying as well. They looked so happy and kept telling me that they prayed to God every day to just see me and that I was happy/healthy. We all laughed, we cried, we smiled. It was bittersweet. We asking questions and answering them through smiles, tears, and laughter. \\n\\nUnfortunately, a lot of time has passed, and that would be the first and only time I would have seen my grandmother. She died unexpectedly on December 24th, 2017. (R.I.P. Abuela Ramona) \\n\\nHopefully, I can make a trip out to Cuba this year so that I can meet my family. My mother will not be joining me on my trip as she does not want to be part of that. I am not mad at my mother, I am just disappointed in the way she kept such a secret from me. I do not trust her on the same level as I did prior to all of it. My hands are shaking as I write all of this down. I am still trying to wrap my head around it. It is 2018 now and I will be planning a trip this summer to see them hopefully. The realization is hitting me that I am anxious beyond belief. I felt as though I babbled a little too much, but I needed to get this all out. This was therapeutic for me. I am going to sleep now, good night ladies and gentlemen. Sleep well.\\n\\nI will be making a new post about meeting them.

However, she continually asks me very simple, basic business questions that many non-business majors would know, stuff that I would think would've been covered over the first few classes. She's originally from a different country and still struggles a bit with English yet she went to school in Canada where all the courses were taught in English. The way I see it, if there was that much of a language barrier, she wouldn't have been able to pass. Even if she had gotten help with her studies, she still would have needed to retain this knowledge long enough to pass her exams, which weren't that long ago. The only thing I can fathom is that she had other people doing her work for her and taking her exams but I don't want to believe that and, besides, it's a bit of a stretch. \\n\\n\\nAs well, she currently has a mentor who's supposedly helping her conduct business research, yet she still messages me with questions about assignments they've given her, saying she doesn't understand basic stuff. I even told her that if she doesn't understand what her mentor is assigning her, she should be forthright and tell them, otherwise they wouldn't be able to fully help her. She agreed but I noticed she's still asking me the same questions insteading of contacting her mentor. \\n\\n\\nAnyone have any insight into this?

He is negative and annoying, and genuinely makes the time we spend together unpleasant. \\n\\nHow do I tell my friend that I don't want to hang out with Tony without coming across as a dick? Is there ever a point when I am candid about the reasons why? \", 'Long distance girlfriend\\'s family abusive to her\\nI\\'m in a long distance relationship, and my girlfriend\\'s family totally neglects her. She has a mom, dad, and older sister.  The older sister is constantly cherished, and in her parent\\'s eyes, does nothing wrong. My gf has to buy anything she wants, while her older sister gets everything handed to her. My gf gets almost straight A\\'s, her older sister flunks classes. My gf\\'s parents help pay for her sister\\'s tuition, but kinda just shrug in her direction. Basically, her sister gets everything, and she gets the rags. Just today her sister went and broke her iPad screen for no reason, and her mom said she didn\\'t believe her when she told her what happened. The older sister never gets grounded, but the gf gets grounded almost everyday, sometimes because her family \"doesn\\'t wanna see her face.\" So fucked up, right?\\n\\nDoes anybody think there\\'s a way for her to cope with her family\\'s behavior? She\\'s (hopefully) moving away to attend school in a year. ', \"Should I cut her off finally?\\nBeen knowing bestie since we were 14 (now 30), we've been through a lot blah blah. In the past year or so, I've sensed she sort of feels envy or jealousy, not sure which. Things like being short in messages (HATE this), not reciprocating advice when I always do (I got accepted into university and she barely acknowledged, just like to hear support sometimes, and then proceeds to try to enroll sooner at same school and tells me, expecting congratulatory response of course, or even advice over guys), being overly aggressive and controlling when she drinks (have cut back going out A LOT due to this); so any who, I don't want to lose her but am at point in my life  where I don't want any negativity, she's been through a lot, and sometimes I feel she needs me more than I need her. I'm stuck but gearing towards letting her go, but just unsure, maybe I'm overreacting? :(\", \"not invited to friends party, yet others who barely know her were?\\nso, i wasn't invited to my close friend's party, yet i've known her for 3-4 years. countless people who don't talk to her were invited and so she can't use the excuse of that she had 'limited room/invitations.' also she mentioned to one of my friends, who was invited, that she had sent me an invitation (via text) yet I didn't respond. when it seems as if the text didn't 'go through.' but the fishy thing is that she even made a groupchat. how could a text not go through and how could she forget to add me to a groupchat? \\nI'm just upset and I'm not sure what I did wrong.\\nI don't want to confront her because either she'll get upset, or she'll just say 'it was a mistake.' yet somehow i don't believe it was and I want to know what I did wrong.\", 'Having to share a small living space with Grandpa\\nMy grandpa and I are having trouble adjusting to our new living situation, and I was wondering if anyone had any ideas to help us in this predicament.\\n\\nBackstory:\\n\\nI never really saw eye to eye with him while growing up. He was quite the wild prankster, and his antics often left me humiliated and embarrassed. Back in my boyhood of 1991, he pantsed me while I performed at the school talent show. He routinely mentions this while at family gatherings, and it has subsequently caused me extreme grief. This trend of surprise humiliation lasted for two decades. Just when I thought me and gramps were cool again, I\\'d feel my pants hit the ground. He\\'s  deprived me of my sanity, as well as given me an extreme fear of public speaking scenarios. I ended up forcing him to go to family counseling with me, and he denied the whole thing. After turning in historical footage (my mom always cam-corded my recitals or graduation ceremonies), he finally gave in and admitted to his rude behavior. It took a couple dozen sessions, ending with a mock-talent-show, where I played my trumpet for the therapist. Gramps just sat there, cool as ice. With arms folded, he nodded to me - and that\\'s where things changed.\\n\\nAnyhow, I had an extra ticket to go see Teagan and Sara - so I got ol\\' gramps on the phone. He kinda razzed me for listening to such feminine sounding music, but eventually accepted my invitation. I picked him up and brought him to the venue. The ticket office said there was a mixup, and that we\\'d get front-row seats. This was my lucky day, as well as a great way to finally bond with the old codger. \\n\\nIt took a couple of songs, but he really got into it. He was so exuberant, jumping up and down on his seat. He pulled me up, and I did the same. After the first half of the set wrapped up, the sisters on stage looked down at gramps and I. They asked us if we were having a good time, and also the nature of our relation. A stage hand passed down a microphone to gramps. \\n\\n\"I\\'m here with my grandson!\"\\n\\nThere was this big \\'awwww\\' that came from the crowd. They asked us how long he\\'d been a fan, and he mentioned the fact that I would sometimes play their songs on my trumpet. To my amazement, they pulled me and gramps on stage for the next song. They got me a trumpet and instructed me to play a solo to \"I was a fool\" - It was literally one of the best moments of my life. I was on stage with my favorite sister duet band.\\n\\nRight as I put the brass mouthpiece to my lips, I felt those wrinkly little fingers jutting into my belt loops. I tried to stop him, but my pants hit the ground before I could react. I wanted to die in that moment. Security ended up escorting us out of the venue, where a police officer was waiting for us.\\n\\nNow we\\'re both cell mates for the next year. We got caught in some type of legal double-whammy. He, being the pantser, was ruled guilty for sexual assault. Me, the pants-ee, was convicted of exposure and indecency. Both of us will have to register as sex offenders once we\\'re out of the clink. \\n\\nAnyhow - I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions on how we could pass the time together? Any board games or things like that? We have a whole year of time to kill, and it really took being cellmates for me to understand exactly how generation gapped we are. Anyhow, your advice is greatly appreciated. I gotta hide this phone, but I\\'ll check for your replies later tonight. \\n\\nThanks!', 'Money and power are your friend, not human beings!\\nI am cynical about friendship from my recent experience. \\n\\nI am from a well-off family but Iâ\\x80\\x99d tried to live by my own and lived in a very tiny studio. To my well-off friends, I might look humble. They partied, traveled, and dined together without me, and kept those in secret (some of those events were blurted by mutual friends).

When I really needed someone in order to be discharged from a hospital, that person didnâ\\x80\\x99t help me even though she could - she didnâ\\x80\\x99t even hide it. \\n\\nMy parents didnâ\\x80\\x99t like me living in a small place rent, so they bought me a very nice condo.

In fact, itâ\\x80\\x99s more than ok. Yes, he is my friend but our connection is deeper than that. We are building our lives as one. Sharing our day to day, filling them with constant support and security. I love my husband deeply but we are also different people. He plays video games and I do arts and crafts. He watches war movies and I go to brunch. I value my friendships &amp; consider them a priority in a different light than the priority my spousal relationship takes. Because of our many differences, I take and make the time to build on my friendships. If their partners are their best friends, I am truly so happy for them. What a beautiful thing to find.\\n\\n  However, I tend to notice that those are the friends that often get jealous of my other friendships or the plans I make with others. I hope that I make it clear how much they mean to me because that is all I can do. I donâ\\x80\\x99t have a live-in best friend. I donâ\\x80\\x99t spend all of my hours or all of my days with my partner. I have different people in my life for different reasons. I love them all. I think my biggest insecurity/worry is that feeling that Iâ\\x80\\x99m sometimes expected to put my life, needs or other friendships on hold while those with â\\x80\\x9cpartner bffsâ\\x80\\x9d hang out with their bffs. Not everyone can understand, so I have to teach myself to let go of the guilt. Truthfully though I just reaaaaallly wish my friends with bff partners could understand so theyâ\\x80\\x99d stop getting jealous. They want me to be and still call me their best friend but they already have one. We were â\\x80\\x9cbest friendsâ\\x80\\x9d till they found their partners and I harbor zero resentment for that, all I want is happiness for all of us. Sure you can have more than one best friend, but I simply donâ\\x80\\x99t take their priority anymore.  But so I have to move on, ya know? I keep in touch and try to maintain our friendship but when I get closer to a different friend it angers them in a way. If I make plans for a trip with a different friend I am ridden with guilt. Do I just tell myself to get over it? Iâ\\x80\\x99m doing my best? I know thereâ\\x80\\x99s nothing but love on my part. So itâ\\x80\\x99s not truly my problem, right? (Easier said than done with that mindset though)\\n\\nTLDR: my friends boyfriends/fiancÃ©s are their best friends. They get jealous of me getting close with or making plans with other friends while theyhangs with their bff partners. Not my fault right?', 'I\\'m going to the party\\nAwhile back I was out drinking with my aunt. She decided to tell me a\" huge family secret\"  that my father was murdered by the guy my mom dated after he died. And that my mom was complicit. \\n\\nThat my gramma and uncle , both dead now believed this too. That some doctor at the hospital said he looked as if he had been beaten to death. \\n\\nThis pissed me off and confused me greatly since  my mother can\\'t speak up for herself. She died  7 yr\\'s ago. \\n\\nMy aunt wasn\\'t even there when my dad died in front if all us kids and my mom from an aneurysm when I was 2. \\n\\nThis explains a lot about how I always felt me and my mom were outcast by my dad\\'s family over the years. \\n\\nYes my mom was a hippy and my dad\\'s family didn\\'t approve of her since she already had 4  kids when they married.\\n\\n Yes after he died she dated one of their mutual friends, who was black which they also disapproved of. \\n\\nThat night riding my bike home from the bar I was crying and so confused praying to my mom and dad why would she say this to me? \\n\\nSo i called my big sister/ best friend who calmed me down saying no, she was there, he wasn\\'t murdered, my aunt just talking shit. \\n\\nMy aunt  called me next day asking me not to tell my siblings what she said. She said she was afraid  the suspected murderer might come after her?! \\n\\n Anyway by that time it was too late , but i didn\\'t tell her that. I promised not to tell. I shouldn\\'t have lied but the whole thing was just so bizarre I couldn\\'t keep it to myself. \\n\\nMy brother messaged her on FB that she was wrong, that he was there and saw everything , my dad was not murdered. \\n\\nThe fact she would say that about my mom really upset all of us. \\n\\nWell since my brother messaged her, my aunt and my cousins completely ghosted me and my kids over the holidays and everything. \\n\\nBefore then we were close travelling together and going to events and parties all the time. My kids don\\'t get it. Where is auntie they say , can we go visit? I just say she\\'s busy.\\n\\nSo yesterday my cousins ex posted about a birthday party for her 3 yo son. I msgs her me and my 4 and 7 yo would like to go. She said sure sorry she forgot to invite us. \\n\\nSo now I\\'m about to go and see all of them for the first time since all the bs. Im nervous but I know it\\'s the right thing to do. Give me strength mom and dad!', \"Uneasy family members\\nI have had a rough and lonely childhood, in fact i do not want to remember my childhood. There used to be daily fights in the house between my mom and dad. My mom used to talk rudely then and talks rudely even now. She behaves differently outside the house and is a complete different person inside the house, behaves as though we are a burden for her. My dad is no angel either, he is arrogant and adamant, impatient and often has anger control problems, never felt close to him when a child and even now. Never felt any love towards my parent, I always had thoughts about running away from them. To add fuel to the fire my Father's mother will try to instigate any fight on any trivial matter between my mom and dad,I stayed all along with her throughout my childhood but I always thought of her as a monster. She never allowed me or my brother to ever mingle with other children freely and we didn't have many friends. I feel suffocated between my family and want to move away from them shift to another place and be independent. I have finished my graduation and still stay with my family but i feel they sap my energy and I am always negative and depressed staying with them. Criticism is a big part of our family, you are not spared if you make even a minute mistake. Appreciation word is not in my family's dictionary. On top of that my family is conservative and my mom is very very conservative in the bad sense. She will criticize other girls and women for wearing slightly short or tight clothes, but if someone wears the same clothes in our family she will applaude it. My father too judges women based on the clothes they wear and how they look, he doesn't spare men either calling them names based on their physical features. I am tired with this outlook and want to leave the house as soon as possible.There is no room for opinion in my family, especially my father who does not want to listen to anybody else and has fought with me on several occasions. He does not spare me insulting in front of other people. I don't feel easy staying along with them and at the same time feel guilty for depending financially on them. I have always felt hate for them in my heart and mind. Though they have provided me with all the facilities they have not provided understanding and love...they never understood me.What should I do?\", 'Relationship with my Dad\\nHey, I post this as I need help on how to deal with the situation on my relationship with my Dad. Don\\'t get me wrong, I do love him- however I am not sure that I like him to the extent that he likes me. By like, I mean as a \"buddy\" relationship, we have similar interests and we talk about these interests a lot, but his personality irritates me and we have gotten in a lot of arguments, of which I never convince him.\\n\\nI am currently in University, I am living on campus (this is the first time living on my own), and I must say: I am absolutely loving it. Having my first time being independent has made me feel much better. Mainly because I am away from home. I have this thing where I just want to be independent, not influenced by other people\\'s views/thoughts (my Dad mainly). A couple of years ago my Mum and Dad broke up, I stayed with my Dad as I did not agree with what my Mum had done. Me and my Dad were always close as we are both into Gaming and watching TV shows etc... but it is only recently that I have realized I dislike him. \\n\\nMy Dad can be quick at losing his temper, he lives by the policy of Honesty (which is a good trait), but at the same time- he is completely contradicting. In arguments we get into, I explain my view and so does he, however he turns my view against me and then later apoligises for not understanding, making sure he will listen better in future. This never happens. This has persisted over the years and it makes me feel uneasy talking to him about anything. I then feel guilty about not wanting to talk to him. Which brings me to my next issue.\\n\\nHe talks to me daily. Once in morning, some points during the day and then at night. I understand this is his first time living alone too, but I need my space and it is physically and mentally draining having to talk to him. Especially as I feel forced to keep the conversation going. Pretty much the majority of the conversation is me talking about my day, my thoughts on things and anything interesting that happened. He briefly mentions his stuff, but then there is silence. I try to keep the conversation flowing, but it does NOT feel natural at all. It is not like the conversations I have with my friends or other members of the family. Which again, makes me feel guilty when I want to hang up. I really have tried to change my perspective. \\n\\nIt is getting close to moving back home (I am a first year student) and will be commuting from my home town to University for the upcoming years at Uni. I am really not looking forward to this. I am enjoying spending time AWAY from home, to avoid my Dad. Now I am going to have to live with him for the next few years. \\n\\nNow I do love him, and he does everything for me. He is trying to pay off my Student loans so I feel comfortable, and I have been saving for my deposit that I will put on a house after my time at Uni. But the issue is, I really want independence. I feel guilty that I want to live in the city where my Uni is and work to pay joint rent with friends. This way I learn the world of work, but that comes with having higher stress as I\\'d have to work and study. Which is what my dad doesn\\'t agree with. And trying to explain to him that I want to learn the world of work does not compute with him. As rationally speaking, there are many more benefits of me commuting. And I cannot win, I really can\\'t. He wants me to get the best oppotunity I can in life, and make sure that I get my Masters. But, he is deciding and forcing my path for me. I feel restricted and it makes me feel down most days for each time I have to talk to him. It just reminds me of the next 3 years being stuck at home with him, him thinking we have this great relationship where I just prefer literally anything else. \\n\\nThank you.', '\"You can count on me\" That sweet lie.\\nMaybe this post is a way to vent. Maybe I just need to feel like someone, somwhere has read this and, in a way, I\\'ve actually said it.\\n\\nI don\\'t have many friends, but the ones I do have, I consider them quite close. One of them (let\\'s cal him Joel) is by far the one whom i have a closest relationship with we are bouth 30 right now. I met him as the boyfriend of a workmate about 7 years ago and even after they broke up we stayed as friends.\\n\\nJoel has a tendency for depression, and I\\'ve always tried to help him in any way possible. Because of this problem he ended up hooked on Cocaine, he admited it to me, and we tried everything possible to solve it. So far he seems to be dealing with it reasonably well, but I\\'ve had some very rough nights in which i would recieve a text message, wake up at 4 am, grab my keys and drive to his home to literally hold him in my hands while he cried back to sleep and then sand the rest of the night outside his bedroom\\'s door. \\n\\nBasically, When I say the words \"You can count on me for anything\" I really mean it, and I think I\\'ve proved that to him.\\n\\nFast forward to last May and, for the first time in many, many years (before i even met him) I was hit with depression myself for various reasons. \\n\\nIt hit me hard, suicide attempt hard. \\n\\nI tried to deal with it by myself, but finally turned to him and told him what was happening during what I consider the worst night so far in my life. The night I hugged my dog, left him at a friends house \"for a few days because i had to leave the city for work\" and drove to the forest with the intention of not comming back.\\n\\nIn that forest I called Joel in tears, told him whats was happening to me (didnt tell him what i was planning) and he literally said \"I feel bad i can\\'t go there, but I had promissed someone else I havent seen in a while to hang out tonight\" but told me I \"could count on him for whatever I needed\".\\n\\nTo say I was shocked would be an understatement.\\n\\nObviously I didnt end my life that day, but I could not believe what had happened. I tried to ignore it, called Joel the very next day and asked him to meet me whenever it was possible.\\n\\nThis was in May.\\n\\nI would not see Joel\\'s face until September 2nd after basically begging him to meet up.\\n\\nI\\'m writing this on November 26, and we have met once since then, a day I had to beg for again in which i planned to tell him how I was dealing with my problem.\\n\\nHe invited a girlfriend he just met and a co-worker to said meeting.\\n\\nI find myself thinking about this every day, about how a person can be so selfish to have a friend, someone temselves call his best friend, in this situation and proceed to ignore it and basically run away.\\n\\nAfter all we have been through this situation is hurting me far more than the reasons that nearly drove me to suicide some months ago.\\n\\n\\nI want to tell something to everyone who has taken the time to read this.\\n\\n \\n\\n**Never say \"You can count on me\" if you dont mean it,** you may think you do, but consider if you are actually up to the task.

Otherwise, we were always talking to eachother and we cared for and loved eachother a great deal and did heaps for eachother but yeh she did in fact cut me off because I didn't reply to her messages one day. Anyway we haven't communicated at all since then but I sent her a letter for this year 12 camp we did so it's a graduation letter dedicated to her. I told her I would send it to her when we were friends and I'm not sure if she's forgotten but it is going to be sent to her. The contents of it go along the lines of thanking her, stating how much I appreciate her and that I'll always be there for her no matter the situation in 1 1/2 pages.

I'm 26. The concept of him having nothing new to teach me and needing me to take care of him now is truly devastating, because it's hitting me how much time has gone by, and just the idea of me being more capable than my father is a bit scary. He's healthy, smart, independent, wise. He still seems the same as he always did except for being a bit more gray, and you can see the age in his face a bit clearer. He drives himself around, works, volunteers, has a long distance relationship. He just seems to be a bit upset and nervous about the state of my life. Like I'm always complaining and yammering about something and it's hard on him. Yet all he wants to do is help me, so he keeps trying, and every time, he just gets put through the ringer and it's hard on him. I feel so bad because I say very harsh things and he's such a fragile person, trying so hard to be tough in this world. And I know shocking the system when you're old is hard on you. So I'm trying to just be mature, put all of the mess behind me, and ensure evevery time him and I are together now, he can see that I'm all good, grown up, and not going to make everything bad for him again.

I simply want to be able to find out if I will also not want any in the distant future.\", 'My friends acting dumb and I donâ\\x80\\x99t know what to do?\\nSo I have a â\\x80\\x9cfriendâ\\x80\\x9d. Letâ\\x80\\x99s call this â\\x80\\x9cfriendâ\\x80\\x9d B. Iâ\\x80\\x99ve known B for most of my school life (we didnâ\\x80\\x99t talk from K to 5th grade bc different classes and moving away). In 6th grade she was the only friend I had in academic classes and we both formed a squad (spoiler: it didnâ\\x80\\x99t last). Essentially we were very close and have a lot of inside jokes.\\n\\nStarting last April, B started ignoring me after I told her I wanted to do an assignment sheet alone. She took it the wrong way and we ended up fighting the entire break. We made up quickly and life was normal again. Another long ass fight happened over the summer for unknown reason. Then in November, I saw B at Target with someone she hated (lets call her E) at the time (B still does). What pissed me off that B fucking cat-fished E the same week. Again, made up 2 weeks later.\\n\\nSheâ\\x80\\x99s probably the only friend that actually asks to hang out with me (I have other friends btw). B likes to play these ditching pranks when I would leave then B and her other friends would leave me. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s also destroyed my stuff after I told her no. One of my other friends (letâ\\x80\\x99s call her A) told me that she was obsessed with me that every time when hanging out with B, B would mention me and it creeps me out. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know how to deal with the friendship since Iâ\\x80\\x99m scared to deal with B. Any advice?\\n\\nTLDR: My friend is toxic and obsessed with me. I donâ\\x80\\x99t know how to break it off without hurting her feelings?', \"My mother died...Left me more the siblings\\nMy mother died recently. She had a retirement account and life insurance. I have two siblings. The benefits are being paid and She left me much more then them. I received about 50-60% of her money. I feel guilty and I'm afraid my siblings will forever have animosity towards me and my mother. Both siblings left long ago. One out of state and one out of the country. I was the only one around for my mom for more then 15yrs. She got cancer three years ago along with other illnesses and suffered a great deal. I was the only one here to help. Her last year and a half was very tough and I was her full time caregiver. I gave up a everything. As a business owner I Lost most my clients, compiled a mountain of debt and now I am alone to care for her house ( I gave up my place) and pay the mortgage. One sibling says it's unfair that I got more then twice him. The conversation killed me because I think he is hurt by it and I feel guilty. My mom told them before she died that I got the lions share but he says he didn't think it was this much of a disparity. I don't know what to do or how I should feel. She always told me she had her reasons. Part of me thinks that fair isn't always equal and I want to tell him that. At the same time I don't want to feel entitled or like I deserve something more. I don't know what to do if anything. I don't feel like I should give them some of my inheritance. \\n\\nI guess I am looking for a little validation and a little advise. \\n\\nside note: I don't think insurance companies and retirement funds should reveal the total policy or amounts and beneficiaries payout percentage. This is what causes problems. \", \"Friends making ammends\\nI previously wrote about this. A friend and I got into a fight where I said I don't know if I can be friends because a situation occurred where I was hurt and many different events kept piling up. I knew I felt very depressed with that friendship though she never really did something bad like other people post on here. It was more like she did something I was not okay with and she never really reached out to me ( months). She was my best friend and someone I love and care about. I know I made my mistakes as well. She texted me to reach out and I talked to normally to her didn't get angry/say anything angry... just small talk... \\n\\nCan we ever be close friends again and how? Should I now reach out or just focus on me? A problem we had was because she never reached out and now she did.. so is it my turn and when will it be appropriate? \", \"How can I tell me friend that I don't want to babysit his (difficult) kid?\\nI want to be a good friend, and there for him in case of emergencies. I've picked up his kid from daycare before when his babysitter called out on him. But then he asked me to babysit and the hours ended up being 8AM to 7PM(!). He asked me two weeks ago if I could babysit on February 3rd, and I told him I couldn't make a commitment so far in advance. (Knowing he'd have plenty of time to find a sitter). This is clearly not an emergency, and he's about to ask me again (it's a week away). I know I shouldn't have led him on at all; that it's better to be direct. But dear god, I cannot come up with the words to tell him I would rather die than spend any more time alone with his son. Last time I saw his kid, he literally threw a toy car at my face and it hit me in the mouth. He's incredibly defiant and screams bloody murder all day. He refuses to hold my hand if I take him out of the house to the park and screams and screams and I just hate that kidd!!!!!!! \\n\\nI know I can't tell him how much I dislike being around his kid, and I don't want to end up hinting at this. Any suggestions on a response text? I don't want to have to keep telling him I have plans. I want him to stop asking. \", 'When should you receive photos of your childhood?\\nHey all,\\n\\nMy mother has all my childhood photos and memories locked up in her closet, along with those of my late father and his family, most of whom are long gone.\\n\\nI\\'m 37, married, father of 2... I\\'m just realizing the absurdity of this.  The other day she offered to exchange one box of photos for another \"favor\" she wanted, which seemed rather hollow to me.  These are my photos, right?\\n\\nThe way she\\'s currently handling it is that I\\'ll only get these photos once she\\'s dead... That could be up to 20 years or more, she\\'s 76 currently.  \\n\\nWhat makes this even more poignantly absurd is that I nearly died 2 years ago, the emergency surgery only had about 50% odds of survival.\\n\\nWhat is she gaining by this?  Is this normal?  \\n\\nThanks', 'My Wifes Car, Money, and My Brother. What do I do?\\nMy wife and I got married, but instead of an engagement ring, we decided I would buy her a car instead. I brought the Toyota and moved in. She already owned another Honda. This way we would have 2. \\nEventually, she gave her Honda to her brother (who was also in need), and I told her she could give it to him because her dad had initially bought the Honda anyway, not her, so he has every right to own that Honda especially since we had 2 at the time. Keep i mind that it was ultimately my decision, not hers, to let him have the car, because although I\\'m married to her and her dad bought her the car, I felt like since her dad \"bought\" it, he has the right to it, and since her brother is her dads \"male\" descendant, he has the right to the car. (Sorry we\\'re an asian family)\\nSo now we have 1 Toyota (the engagement ring car). With a baby on the way, we decided we would lease another Nissan ourselves, so we could have 2 cars again.\\nRecently my brother was involved the Caribbean island Hurricanes where he goes to Med School, and his whole semester was shifted back to America until either this August or December. \\nSo now he\\'s also in need of a car for about 8-9 months. I told my wife that since we are leasing a Nissan, we can let my brother borrow our current Toyota for the time being. \\nMy wife doesnt want to give up the Toyota to him in fear that she will lose it.\\nI thought this was unjustified because she gave her Honda to her brother, so why can\\'t I let my brother borrow the Toyota too? \\nBoth of us grew up believing in \"helping\" a person in need, and I feel like I went out of my way to let her brother have a car that was rightfully hers, but she didnt let me do the same when it came to my brother. But then again, I feel like she does have a right to the Toyota because it was a replacement for an engagement ring at the time. \\nAfter her brother took the Honda, we have been using 1 car for the last year. I figured we could keep using 1 car for another 8-9 months if it means saving my parents some money in buying my brother a different car. \\nAm I wrong here? Is she technically right? Am I unreasonable because what we do with the car should be my wife\\'s decision, since it was a replacement for her ring? ', \"I have never met or know what my real father looked like. That changed this week. Also I found out I have two more sisters.\\nSo, my wife's family is really into ancestry and tracing lineage all the way back they can. Because of this, my wife really wanted to do 23andme and, being the good husband I try to be, I got her kits as a gift. Fast forward to Monday, the day I got my reports back. I'm scrolling through, ooo'ing and aww'ing at the things I didn't know, and then I go to their DNA relative section. Now, my wife had a few 3rd or 4th cousins who did the kit as well. Not me. I had one half sister listed. I was immediately stunned, because I only knew my real father's name and this girl had his last name. After sending a few messages, we find out that, yes in fact, she is my other half-sister (I have a half-brother and two other half-sisters)! Not only that, but I have two other half-sisters! \\n\\nMy whole world was turned upside down this week. Prior to this, I had no interest in finding or knowing my real father. But, after seeing his picture for the first time and seeing how my sisters revere him. I am considering it. ON TOP OF THAT, this whole turn of events is like a Lifetime movie plot. Sadly he was in a car accident last week and was in critical condition. Even if I wanted to reach out, I don't think now is a good time. \\n\\nSo, for now, I'm getting to know my new-found sisters and I'm very excited. We all want to meet up at some point!\", \"I have a close friend who is problematic, but not towards me\\nA couple of years ago, I had a falling out with one of my friends and during this time, I fell back on this girl in my class, who I will call Blue. We got close in only a few months, and eventually, this will be the only time we will ever be in the same class. It was just the two of us. I'm in one of her classes now and my friends still associate me as her best or one of her closest friends. It's not a particularly good association (doesn't reflect on me though, just her).\\n\\nA lot of people don't like her, especially the people I'm friends with now. I haven't been around for a while (I moved down to Brighton for a bit of time) and I haven't seen her either, but I know that she doesn't have a lot of friends. I've been hearing stories and past anecdotes about her that really troubled me, so I'd like to have some advice.\\n\\nThis one girl (who would never lie about something like this because she's so sweet, probably still hasn't gone through puberty) said that Blue once pit her up against the teachers and made her cry because she was so stressed and she didn't understand the situation. Blue has a kind of controlling personality and will not be open-minded to other people's ideas and input. An idea of close friend of my close friend, Yellow, was swept by as Blue simply dismissed it, and just wrote what she wanted to do in a group project. Yellow is also quiet, VERY passive and formerly a good friend of Blue and to some point, even I, so when I heard this happening to Yellow, I was really shocked that Blue could even do something like that.\\n\\nShe will also guilt-trip you and self-deprecate herself. She will tell you that everyone hates her and that she's really bad at a subject she does really well in. It's annoying, and sometimes I even hear it, but to others she does it in this really soft, guilt-tripping voice. It's a problem because often, she's the problem and then she guilt-trips to turn it to look like she's saying that the people calling her out are just trying to make her feel bad. \\n\\nBut Blue has never done any of this to me. When I'm around her, we talk about our futures and Star Wars. She jokes and memes a lot, but because we're not as close anymore, they aren't as funny. I avoid confrontation too so I almost never rebutt her points. Recently, she apologized to me about how poor her behaviour was back then, but I didn't understand what she was talking about. Now, I get it. But her behaviour wasn't just 'back then' either, it was also just a couple (maybe about two) years ago. Maybe even now, but everyone has probably already distanced themselves from her.\\n\\nShe also has this fake 'caring' voice that she uses around the people in her music group. She never uses this voice around me, but the music people all generally speak like that. The thing is, the 'caring' side to her is just like a mask, and the people who know her know that she's not usually like that. She has hurt their friends who don't deserve to be hurt, and for no apparent reason either.\\n\\nI know that most of my friends feel uncomfortable bringing her up around me because it'll be something negative (I've never heard anyone who really knows her say something positive about her), but because of that I've been sheltered to how she treats her classmates. Another girl (Red) once said that while she was consoling a friend who didn't like to be touched, Blue came in, wrapped her arms around the sobbing girl and 'glared' at Red like one of those mean girls. Never have I ever heard something so cliched and dramatised, but unfortunately, I could definitely picture it.\\n\\nWhen I'm around her, I definitely don't feel like her personality is weighing down on me, but I'm conscious of the connotations surrounding her. All the girls mentioned are also my friendly mutuals, so they don't associate me with her, as I'm generally polite, quiet and will crack a joke around them. I also know that Blue doesn't like people so when we were walking from our class, I'm worried that we'll bump into someone that doesn't like her or whom she doesn't like. So yes, I am very bothered about how people view her, mostly because there actually is something to dislike.\\n\\nWhat should I do? Slowly back out of this friendship? Should I slowly doorslam her until the end of the year when our class is over? Should I just continue being her friend despite her bad behaviours? \\n\\nTwo things: the stories are most definitely true, and I don't want Blue to know that I know about her being a bad classmate. I overheard these stories from reliable people.\\n\\nSorry for the long post. Please help.\", 'New friends\\nHi,\\n\\nIâ\\x80\\x99m new here. I have a huge problem. \\nItâ\\x80\\x99s extremely hard for me to trust people I have a bond with (friends). Out of fear of rejection or disapproval for my actions, I donâ\\x80\\x99t dare to become closer. I fear people will leave me eventually, so the idea that I have friends, isnâ\\x80\\x99t present. When it is present, I feel like I need to stay in touch very often. \\nI feel reluctant to take initiative often. If I donâ\\x80\\x99t get asked for something, itâ\\x80\\x99s a strong sign Iâ\\x80\\x99m not wanted. This has become standardized.\\nI have some vague friends, but they live far away.

', '[Need Advice] best friend (21f) moving in with my dad (dad age) and I (21f)\\nMy best friend and I have talked about living together plenty of times. Now itâ\\x80\\x99s really happening because her family is moving out of state and she has nowhere to go. My dad and I live in an apartment together and share expenses (though he pays for most of it). Itâ\\x80\\x99s a pretty good situation, but there are anxieties we both have about my friend moving in.\\nShe is unemployed and has been for a while. The deal was that she could move in once she got a job (the deal was made like 7 months ago), but she is still jobless and her family is leaving in 3 days. Weâ\\x80\\x99re letting her move in, and luckily her mom is willing to help out with her expenses until she gets a job. But here are the worries:\\nâ\\x80¢ She had a lot of time before this to get a job, what if she takes even more time even after sheâ\\x80\\x99s moved in? My dad and I know from experience how difficult getting a job can be, but also expected her to have one by now.\\nThe thing is, sheâ\\x80\\x99s very picky (even when she canâ\\x80\\x99t afford to be). She wonâ\\x80\\x99t just take any job, sheâ\\x80\\x99s only applying to places sheâ\\x80\\x99d prefer to work at. Which I totally get! But at some point you just gotta do something even if you hate it, it wonâ\\x80\\x99t last forever and will even help you get to doing something you donâ\\x80\\x99t hate. Sheâ\\x80\\x99s repeatedly said that sheâ\\x80\\x99s â\\x80\\x9cnot the kind of person that can work a job she doesnâ\\x80\\x99t likeâ\\x80\\x9d. And that is definitely making it take longer for her to find work. But what can ya do?\\nâ\\x80¢ Another thing is, my dad and I (my dad especially) have had not-so-great experiences with friends/acquaintances moving in. Thatâ\\x80\\x99s definitely made both of us have some not-so-great feelings about this situation (even if it may end up being really good!). A lot of things can ruin this and itâ\\x80\\x99s hard to know how to avoid those things while still being a friend. Itâ\\x80\\x99s a thin thin line.\\nâ\\x80¢ my dad and I (my dad more than me) are also worried about compatibility. My dad and I get along great and itâ\\x80\\x99s been no problem for us to live together. We have an unspoken agreement on bills, chores, privacy, etc. It just works. How can we keep that agreement while including a whole new person who might not think the same way?\\nFor instance, I donâ\\x80\\x99t know much about the way she lives. I know how itâ\\x80\\x99s been with her family, but things are different when you leave home. Itâ\\x80\\x99s tough to say how it will be, but my dad is worried that she wonâ\\x80\\x99t be the kind of clean, kind, generous person he expects a friend/roomie to be. Itâ\\x80\\x99s tough because I agree with him..\\nâ\\x80¢ thereâ\\x80\\x99s the other matter of an official Roommate Agreement that could be made and signed by the 3 of us. We all think itâ\\x80\\x99s a great idea, but I know how things can still get messy (literally and figuratively) when living with a friend. The problems that can arise are endless and maybe some even unavoidable. All we want is for things to work out well, with the least amount of issues as possible. Communication is key and thatâ\\x80\\x99s the goal of this Roommate Agreement.\\nHowever, there is still that line that we do not want to cross. I want this move-in to be professional as well as friendly. How can my dad and I make the rules clear so that she will take them very seriously without this being like some kind of crazy contract?\\n\\nThanks for even reading this!']\n"
