Warning: This is the first time I've ever described what happened to me in this much detail to anyone, so there will be descriptions of disturbing things including animal abuse.

I've (30's,F) seen a variety of opinions on COCSA (Child on Child) incidents, and as much as I'd like to believe what happened to me when I was a kid was just childhood curiosity or the other child being a victim acting out in a confused way (still may be the case), there are things about this that just make me feel invalidated whenever I read about COC stuff being dismissed or downplayed because it wasn't "an adult" who abused me.

When I was 5-7, I used to go with my dad to visit the farm across the street. It's large, about 100 acres, so there was a lot of distance between my house and their house. My dad would talk farm stuff with the guy and his wife, and I would play with their oldest kid, a son. I'll call him A for the story purpose. Some things about A: He was 2 years older than me, so he was 7 when things first happened, played really rough with his younger sister (younger than me by 1 year), got in trouble for being bad at home a lot, and also had violence problems, particularly towards the farm animals (dogs and cats). A also loved horror movies and would talk about violent, scary movies and things that now as an adult, I realize he should never have been exposed to at that age. (And I'm not blaming media for violence or abuse, I just mean that it could've been a red flag indicator that he was being exposed to OTHER age-inappropriate behaviors, etc.) 

My memories are fairly vague, but some snippets are clear as day to me, and always have been (I'm 34 now). One was that A liked to tie me up with rope, or force me to crawl around in the hay, only to throw heavy bales on top of me and try to trap me underneath. He also tried at one point to make me walk over a very dangerous rotted wood floor where the drop was 20 feet to a concrete floor below, in a barn basement of sorts. He'd scare me by telling me all sorts of disturbing things, like he swore he saw an ant crawl in my ear, and it'll eat my brain while I'm sleeping.  Then he'd laugh and laugh when I got upset and cried. He seemed dead-set on making me cry or panic. Some of it was "innocent child play" that I'm sure caused the adults around to ignore any warning signs-- such as him pretending to be Freddie Krueger and chasing me around their kitchen and into the upstairs. He'd wait til I'd gone to use the bathroom, and would hide so he could jump out at me when I went looking for him. 

BUT here are the things that have always haunted me as COCSA: I remember he would threaten harm to my pets by showing me all sorts of terrible things he'd do to his dogs and cats (pick them up by their tails, kick them, trap them somewhere and laugh about it...I feel sick even typing this). And then he'd tell me that he'd do that to my pets across the street if I told anyone about his "crimes." I suspect I've repressed some memories and I don't htink I'll ever get them back, but I remember clearly that he told me one time that we were going to play a game, and he told me to follow him into the bed of one of his dad's trucks in a barn. He took his pants off, and pulled out his penis. He told me to touch him, and I remember being scared and saying no. Then he told me to show him my underwear, and he had me pull them down. I can't remember if he touched me or not, but I remember him saying, "this is a game and you have to play it right. It's called 'Rubs.' We have to rub my thing against your thing." I think more happened than just that...because I have very vivid memories of some things and then can't recall anything after, or how I got back to the farm house and left with my dad. 

I remember the SMELL of his penis, though. I think he peed on me at one point, too, because I have a vague memory of getting his piss in my mouth and being disgusted. But I remember the smell of his dirty penis as he touched it in front of me. 

The other thing that worries me...is that I had night terrors that began around this age, started grinding my teeth at night, began to have bathroom accidents (embarrassingly, I wet the bed and sometimes had accidents in my pants until I was 9, but managed to never do it at school), AND I have vivid memories of telling my mom that my privates itched and burned, and she gave me baths with oatmeal. She never questioned why. I don't remember my mom or dad ever asking me why I kept getting those yeast infections or burning when I peed. I also had chronic constipation, because I would hide if I had to go and I remember having an aversion to going to the bathroom or doing other things where I had to take down my underwear. Perhaps the most disturbing thing is that I remember a few occasions where I'd take off my underwear during those years and I had some chalky, sticky discharge that smelled bad, and I'd find bits of hay and straw in my panties and would have to pull it out of my private area. Whether someone stuck it up inside me or it just got in my underwear from playing around, I don't know. 

My older sibling refused to play with him, and told me I was stupid and crazy for thinking he was my friend. She never said why, but she judged me more than anything for thinking A was my friend. I didn't have many friends growing up, and I remember thinking A was my buddy and we'd role play sometimes like we were husband and wife or adventure characters. That's the worst part- I think I was so lonely as a child that I wanted to ignore the abusive things (and SEXUALLY abusive things) A did. Most kids would probably tell their parents or refuse to play with someone the second they did something like hit a dog or tie them up. This is why I feel damaged and less than others sometimes- because I feel guilty that I was so willing to still play with him. My parents always tell me what a happy, energetic, and talkative kid I was. I remember I'd tell them everything, so why didn't I tell them about A and his devious behavior? I think it has something to do with the blank parts of my memories and the animal abuse and threats to my pets. 

So...you can maybe see why I think A behaved in ways that were unusual even for a kid his age (would've been 7-9 during this), and were likely indicators that he was victimized himself...but he seemed to be AWARE of what he was doing as bad, and tricked and coerced me into doing things. To me, this is what makes A (in my mind anyway) my legitimate abuser, because he was thinking more like an adult. (BTW he got in trouble years later for threatening to bring a gun to school, and throughout his teen years he was always getting into trouble.) I have sympathy for him if he was being abused by someone in his life. It would explain a lot of his violent and frankly fucked up behavior... but at the same time, it seemed he was determined to terrify me and make me feel as bad as him or worse. For years, it seemed, he succeeded, but it was seen in those effects on my psyche that lurked under the surface.

As an adult, I've only just started to explore my sexuality in earnest. I'm still a virgin in my 30's. I've never had an actual date, and I think I'm bisexual or mostly same-sex attracted. For many years, I also hated identifying as female, and avoided looking feminine at all costs. I'm sometimes afraid and ashamed because I'm finding that many of the things that turn me on echo some of the things he did. (i.e. I find that I'm more aroused when I try to masturbate when I put myself in a submissive position, imagine that I'm tied up or being humiliated or coerced...I know that this is a common fantasy, but it's sometimes troubling bc I have a feeling that the things A did to me got stuck in my brain as a kink or fetish. I do remember being aroused as a child sometimes when we played, but I just didn't know at the time what it was)... as you can imagine, this has made it very hard for me to have any kind of sexual interactions as an adult. It's so risky and scary for me to try to branch out to date or have sex with someone when you fear that the main things that arouse you are from a traumatic sexual abuse incident. Not to mention, the logistics of trusting someone else to do the same things to me is terrifying.

Another story for another day, but I also believe this gave me some serious low self-esteem that lurked under the surface in my childhood and teen years. I had a hard time making lasting friends, would get anxious and shy but try to over compensate by being loud and rambunctious. Sometimes I don't even know what my real personality is, because these dark things kicked in so young for me that I don't know if I ever had anything beyond being fearful and stressed under the surface all the time. When I'm alone, I sometimes try to think of myself as a small child. I think I do this because I am trying to recapture my childhood in a safe context. 

Never been to therapy. I can't afford it. I never really stepped forward to tell anyone ALL of this, because I've always been so conflicted and confused as to whether or not I was even "really" abused, or if it was "just kids playing." I thought I could find some closure and possibly answers here by hearing your thoughts and opinions on this as fellow survivors. Thanks for reading this long rambling thing.
