Just discovered that my uBPD mom has blocked me on LinkedIn. Real mature, right? This is especially ironic given that I’ve spent dozens of hours helping her to build her current freelance business through that platform. I literally wrote her profile and showed her how to network using the site step by step. It was a huge part of our relationship last year — me helping her to get back on her feet using the site. Like many other gestures I’ve attempted with her, it was all in an obsessive effort to secure and maintain her love, kind treatment and approval. 

She now has paying work for the first time in years because of my coaching. But because I’m a bad child who won’t allow her to abuse me anymore, I am now dead to her on LinkedIn. 

Real nice, mom.
