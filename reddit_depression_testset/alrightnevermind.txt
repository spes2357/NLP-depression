So things have been weird lately. Just over a month ago everything exploded. My eDad confronted my uBPD Mum about her behaviour; he usually dismisses/enables it but clearly it was getting out of hand even for him. Then my sister and I were roped into it all and were forced to tell them both everything (we have tried this in the past but it never seemed to make a difference). Mum exploded; screaming, crying, and accusing my dad of being the abusive one - it was completely impossible to reason with her. And then would switch to guilt tripping, saying that she’s a shit wife and parent and that she ruins everything. She kept threatening to just pack her bags and leave. This went on for a few days. Mum couldn’t even be in the same room as my dad, she would go off at him and then storm off without any word as to where she was going; then when we called to check up on her, she said she was confused and didn’t even realise there was anything wrong.

Mum eventually ‘apologised’. She claimed that everything she has done in the past was out of love, and she blamed her behaviour on her depression. Not actually taking responsibility for any of it. 

Since then it was been weirdly calm at home, in the sense that there haven’t been any massive explosions. But I still feel like I’m walking around on eggshells. Mum still makes these offhanded comments, she is still very judgemental, and still is very demanding of my time and energy. All of her smaller habits have remained the same. But am I overreacting? Am I just looking for things that could go wrong or is this the ‘reconciliation’ stage in the cycle of abuse? 

I feel very confused.
