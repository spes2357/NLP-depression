I can’t remember my mom without a drink in her hand. She’s always been like this. I’m 23 now and her drinking and mental/physical health has gotten progressively worse. The first time I remember seeing my mom drink was when I was about 5 or 6 and she’d drink some beers every night after work. Then it was vodka screwdrivers, but she’d still get out on the weekends. But for the last 3 years, she’s drank nothing but fireball whisky straight from the bottle. She’s become a complete hermit. It’s killing her. 

She was admitted to the hospital through the ER on Thursday for pancreatitis due to chronic, heavy alcohol consumption. That exactly what the doctor told her. But I’m terrified she won’t change. And I feel totally alone bc my stepdad is an alcoholic as well. He’d buy her alcohol just to make her happy. I’m also terrified of ending up just like her bc it’s all I’ve ever known. Alcoholism runs in her family. It killed her father and now she’s going down the same path.
