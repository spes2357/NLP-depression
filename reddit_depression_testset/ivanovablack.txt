Am I alone in noticing that generally people are supportive when you talk about a narcissist (escaping them, setting boundaries, sharing abuse stories), but you get shut down quick if you talk about BPDs? Like the BPD gets sympathy and “needs our support” and “means well” but Narcs are the devil. I end up reading Narc Abuse Support posts on social media, which give relevant advice and share stories that resonate with me as an RBB, because the Borderlines seem like some protected community. What the hell? Why is it like this? Or is it my imagination?
