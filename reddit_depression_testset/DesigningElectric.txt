I’ve been VLC with my grandmother after she started talking about my dad sexually abusing me while we were on a tour bus filled with her friends I’d never met before. When I was a kid, she also came over screaming with suitcases saying she was taking me to a shelter as punishment for my friend reporting my Mom to a school counselor. She and my mom made me go to school and tell the counselor that my friend was lying.  My grandparents (and mom) also take issue with my husband because ‘he’s a snob’ ie-he doesn’t allow them to mistreat me or others when he’s around.

I’ve limited myself to sending gifts on holidays , and do that mostly because my uncle has paranoid schizophrenia and lives with them and my grandfathers never been abusive towards me or said an unkind word (both my mom and grandma claim he was abusive to them though and my uncles have the same memories of abuse and they don’t lie).  I sent a huge box of gifts at Christmas and had Christmas pajamas shipped to them and never heard anything or received a card or gift. 

Yesterday, I got a voicemail from my grandma saying she has a surgery coming up and to call her back ASAP and that she needs to ask something of me. My grandma gets surgeries every year-some even optional. They all revolve around her back and neck. The last surgery she went NC with my Mom because they got in an argument. I don’t want to become the primary caretaker for this woman who throws my trauma out there to get attention, but at the same time, they really picked up the slack for my mom’s incompetence and poor planning as a parent (picked me up from school often, watched me on weekends, paid for my summer daycare). And without them,  with my mom’s BPD , jealousy of the attention I got as a kid and malignant narcissism, I think I would have been abused far worse. 

Do I owe it to my grandmother to call them back and see what they need from me?
I’m December I suggested that my Mom get therapy (physical abuse turned mental when I became an adult, told me she choked her husband because “he was drinking and had a look in his eye”, she blatantly lies etc) She hasn’t spoken to me since.
Last year I changed careers and started taking illustration classes to get my portfolio together. I bought a couple hundred dollars worth of these highly pigmented watercolors that show up really well when scanned. I lent them to my Mom when she was taking a community art class and then a couple weeks later she stopped talking to me. 
My new semester’s now started and I’m so bummed out that she has my good watercolors. Since I’m going back to school and I don’t want to take out loans (I still have them from my first degree 😭) , a couple hundred dollars is a lot to us right now. 

My husband said he feels like trying to get them back will make me more upset and we should file our taxes now and replace them with part of our refund . I agree with him that requesting them back might make me feel worse, but I also feel mad because I told her before she stopped speaking to me that I needed them back because of school. 

She’s stayed with us off and on the past few years, for months at a time without contributing in any way, so there’s no reason she’d think I owe her. Does she just want to keep using them that badly, or is she thinking I’m a wimp for not asking for them back? 

Should I forget about them and just make do with what I have? Thank you for listening
