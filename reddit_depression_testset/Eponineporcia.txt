I’ve been NC for about 6 weeks. I’ve had two phone calls from my mom’s siblings. The first was from her sister who has also been “devalued” and dealt with false accusations and the complete breakdown of the relationship with my mom, dealt with lying and rage and the whole mess. So she was just very supportive and understanding and wanted to let me know she understands what I’m going through. That was great. But I also found out from her, through her having a concerned conversation with a mutual friend she has with my mom, that my mom is claiming that I am not speaking to her because I have “issues with my upbringing”. 
Riiiiight. It has NOTHING to do with your ongoing abuse, including the rage-accusatory phone call just last month. It’s all about childhood abuse. Like what is she even saying? “Oh I wish she would get over the child abuse already! It’s in the past!”. How delusional. Yes she abused me in my childhood. And also in my adolescence, my young adulthood, and now in my 30s. It’s so angering to know she’s running around saying that I have some issue with my childhood and that’s the only reason this is happening. What a liar. 

Then last night I had the second phone call. This time from one of her brothers. I didn’t consider him a flying monkey because he was honestly just trying to understand what is happening, and he was very respectful and not accusatory. And once I opened up to him about what REALLY goes on behind closed doors with my mom and her daughters, he stopped any attempt to get me to allow him to play “mediator” and “fix this heartache”. He really did seem to understand that she is abusive and I have no choice but to go NC if I want to preserve my mental health and be a good mother to my own children. 

But he did tell me he was very confused at first, because my mother told him that I was raging at her. It is so absurd. She said she “walks on eggshells” around me. What?! She’s out of her damn mind. She has explosive rage, false accusations, and just general borderline insanity. When we last spoke, the final phone call, I had been texting her asking her to please leave me be as I was very sick and not up to the attack I knew she was stewing for (she had left a message that made it clear that it was time for me to hear what a horrible person I am yet again, and I just wanted to recover from the flu before I had to deal with it). 
But she hunted me down and screamed at me on the phone calling me a selfish manipulative liar and coming out with truly bizarre accusations that were not anywhere close to reality. I was so sick I was laying on my back, coughing away and not able to say much, had to keep pausing to catch my breath to even speak. But according to her I was raging at her. I have learned in therapy to never, never meet her level of emotional outburst. I haven’t raged back at her in at least ten years, I had to unlearn that behavior in order to be a healthy, normal person with a normal freaking life. 

I know she’s an insane, projecting liar. And my uncle believed me when I told him I didn’t rage at her. But my god it makes me so angry that this evil woman who is supposed to be my mother is running around telling family members that I raged at her, when the exact opposite is true. It’s just like it always was: she abuses and then accuses me and my sisters of the abuse. 

Moving forward, if and when I talk to any family about this, I will say upfront that I do not want them to even tell me what she’s saying because I know she lies her ass off and it’s just too much to know what the current lies are. I feel that I’ve done a good job keeping my cool and making it clear to these family members who the real psycho is. But I can’t hear any more and I can’t continue to defend myself against things that aren’t real. I’ve done that my WHOLE LIFE and part of going NC means I don’t have to do that any more! 

I know many of you understand exactly what this is like. THIS is the private hell of having a BPD mother.
I feel so gross, like I will never be normal or sane. I feel like I have Stockholm Syndrome. 

A little bit of background is: 
I was a scapegoat, my mom is undiagnosed and a raging mess. My father was in denial, was an enabler, was also incredibly loving and supportive to me, couldn’t come to terms with what was really happening in his own household as my sisters and I were raised by a covert monster. He passed away over a year ago. I feel this horrible awareness that his passing has allowed me to finally set myself free and go NC. 

I tried for over a year after his death but uBPDm just kept getting worse and more brazen. Final straw was her purposely withdrawing any support (she let the cat out of the bag during her subsequent freakout that she did this on purpose due to her bizarre, unfounded resentments) while I was extremely ill with the flu and had my two little kids to take care of. 
I’ve made the ongoing effort to let her see my kids weekly. Because I also was in deep denial. Well, she couldn’t be bothered to act like a decent human being when I was sick, all she kept texting was “when can I go to this or that activity with the kids again?” As I kept responding things like “I don’t know. I literally can’t get out of bed. I can’t even take care of the kids. MIL has them, ive been in bed for five days straight”, she wouldn’t even respond to my illness. So I finally did what I never ever do (due to a lifetime of abusive training), I texted her a calm message that her actions make me feel hurt and confused, so I would like her to stop texting me until I am well. 

Well, time for her to go on the warpath. She HAD to get to me now to abuse me for daring to state that I had any feelings and that she did anything wrong. She lied to my best friend via text in an effort to get to me (friend didn’t take the bait), she started texting my husband at work to get to me. Mind you I texted her saying I am still extremely ill and would she please just give me the space I asked for to recover. 

No. She wouldn’t. Got me on the phone finally to tell me that I am manipulative, selfish, a liar, lying about having the flu,  that I was uncaring the whole time Dad was dying (I could write a novel on this comment alone. He had ALS. It was horrible. I was there for him every step of the way, did more to care for him than she did which she probably resents the attention I gave. I held his hand as he died, I gave his eulogy, all of this without a shred of support from her as usual). 
She told me I purposely excluded her from holiday plans, even though she was the one who made plans and I worked around HER plans to still make sure to see her. She said I’m selfish because I didn’t read her mind and show up when she hadn’t even invited me to things. When I called her out on how illogical this was she once again called me manipulative, which she has called me all my life. 

I finally opened my mouth and said she’s got some nerve considering the abuse she’s given me all my life. She had no memory of any of it, how amazing for her. No memory of physically abusing me, no memory of all the screaming and accusation, of using me as a confidante and shit-talking every single person I loved since I was a very little child. No memory of neglecting me, no memory of any of it. She ended this horrendous attack by saying “I love you and I hope you feel better soon”. 

I’ve gone NC. She is blocked, can’t call or text. She lives about 15 minute drive away which sucks. You know what sucks the most? The overwhelming guilt I have for keeping her grandchildren away from her now. She has a pathetic life which she created herself, yet I feel guilty. 

I KNOW that it’s in my kid’s best interest. I know she’s an abusive person who acts like an animal. I know she has treated me like a hated dog all my life. There’s so much healing to do (I am and have been in therapy a long time). But the waves of guilt, the concern for her well being, the feeling that I MUST take care of her at all costs to myself, are so real. A lot of the fog has lifted (it’s been about 27 days of NC now), but these feelings are so strong. I’m also having tons of memories now. How could I have let myself be treated like this all my life? How much has her illness truly harmed my brain? How could my Dad have deluded himself that all was well and not protected me? 

Does this get easier? Does this Stockholm syndrome type of stuff fade away? God this is hard. I feel so gross that she’s so deep in my mind. I feel so heartbroken that I am so mistreated that I’m just used to it! 

Thank you everyone for being here. Please help :(
