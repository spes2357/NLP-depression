Thinking back on all the weekends, summers, and afternoons after school we spent just sitting at the house, finding creative ways to entertain ourselves. I never experienced any extra curricular activities because there was never any extra money to pay for them. Whatever wasn’t offered by the school for free was pretty much off limits to us. No music lessons, summer camps, dance, NOTHING. We never even took a family vacation together, not even so much as a road trip. My first vacation with my family didn’t happen until my siblings and I were all grown and working and able to pay our way.

I do not resent my parents for it because if they could have given that to us I believe they would have. But I definitely feel for the younger versions of my siblings and I who got so bored at home. Sure we played outside quite a bit but there was never much more beyond that. The good thing is it turned us all into book worms due to being able to read all the library books we wanted.

My kids don’t know how good they have it with all their soccer, dance, martial arts, summer programs etc.
