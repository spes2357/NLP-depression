I’m 21F and live at home with my dxBPDMum and 18F sibling. My mum has had mental health issues her (and my) whole life, she was diagnosed BPD and C-PTSD in addition to manic depression about 5 years ago. My mums behaviour towards me is certainly more mild than some of the horrible abuse you have experienced. I understand in many cases NC is absolutely essential, in fact I’ve even encouraged my mum to pursue NC with her narcissistic and abusive mother. 

My mother, while deeply troubled, is not on the same level. There’s certainly extreme parentification and she’s very in line with the Waif personality, for reference. 

I decided over a year ago to move out of home for my own mental health. Breaking this news to my mum did not go well and low and behold I still live at home. She’s accepted it now and I’m in the throes of finding a place (not without resistance from her). 

Is it silly to think that this distance is going to massively help our very strained relationship? There is no way I’m ready emotionally to go NC even if it were for the best. I also can’t accept that I can’t help her. 

I’m so worried it’s going to make things worse for my little sister. Surely the role I’ve been filling as her primary support will fall to her now? 

I suppose I’m just wondering if there are people on this sub who manage a relationship with their BPD parents, or aren’t considering NC? I’m so sorry if this is insensitive or a humble brag, but I love my mother and truly believe none of her hurtful behaviours are malicious.
