BPD mom, enabler dad and golden child brother are passive aggressive and love to gaslight me. My brother's child is getting married. It will be a large wedding. I'll be at the important table with them & other people I don't know. 

Is staying silent and being on my phone a good plan? I'm usually a chatty, friendly person which brings up the jealous in my parents and brother. They have trouble in this area. I hate to look rude. I just want to make it through this wedding reception without too much abuse from the less-than-wonderful parents and brother.
