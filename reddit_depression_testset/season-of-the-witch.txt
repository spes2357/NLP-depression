I just wanted to start by saying how helpful this subreddit has been! In helping me validate my own story and feel more and more comfortable with my own ability to trust myself and my instincts about the things I experienced as a child. 

Having said that, I still have so many doubts, and so many instances of potential molestation exist in this weird grey area that I guess I keep gaslighting myself about (as in, talking myself out of believing that they happened) .... but I do feel that as a pattern they point to a definite ongoing violation of physical and emotional boundaries. 

Buckle in ‘cause this is gonna be a long post lol! And TRIGGER WARNING for basically most things associated with CSA!! 

So basically I (27/ Nonbinary AFAB) could never remember much about my childhood, but have displayed so many symptoms of having experienced sexual trauma and always had this icky feeling that something must have happened to me. Things like being hypersexual as a kid, being practically mute with shyness and insecurity, bed wetting till about 11 or 12, extreme anxieties around new people and places, lots of self hate, extreme disgust and hatred of my genitals (which may sound dysphoria related given I’m nonbinary but i don’t associate that hatred with dysphoria at all actually). Then during teenaged years lots of sexually dangerous behavior like sleeping with strangers / putting myself in risky sexual situations like having unprotected sex/ turning to drugs and alcohol in unhealthy ways, also developing bulimia, anorexia and body dysmorphia, and having toxic codependent best friendships one after the other basically all throughout my life since aged 3. 

The last 7 or so years I’ve grown so much and much of those behaviours have changed and I have many healthy friendships and a healthier relationship with my body and sexuality. But what led me to start investigating my childhood for signs of sexual abuse was realising a subtle pattern that I’d ignored in all of my adult relationships. Basically I feel absolutely fine and empowered even when having casual sex and one night stands, but in my relationships I get to a point when we’ve been together maybe 6 months or so and sex starts to become triggering. I dissociate from my body and lose time and basically have a sustained panic attack internally while externally still going through the motions of having sex. In the past I would blame my partners for this happening and even shame them for being too horny, or would feed into a narrative of my not being attracted to them anymore, and it’d become a real issue in the relationship that’d never get resolved. Often in my past relationships I’d only then feel sexually attracted to them again after we’d had a fight or after we’d broken up, and after each of my major breakups we’d then have a weird codependent hypersexual stage of still sleeping together post break up. Which never ended well lol. 

Now I’m finally in a really happy relationship with someone I adore and have started dissociating during sex and feeling that ‘icky’ feeling, which led me down a reddit rabbit hole of learning about covert incest abuse, and basically a floodgate opening of memories from my childhood. 

What I’ve now come to believe is that I was molested by my mum from a very young age. The first memory that arose was of me describing to her the sensations I was feeling in my clit. At first I couldn’t tell if it was just an abstract conversation we were having where I was just exploring my body as little kids often do, but then it became more clear to me that it was her touching me, and her asking me to touch myself and tell her how it felt. I believe it was under a guise of it being educational - like ‘here’s where your wee comes out, this is the vagina opening’ etc like a sex Ed lesson. But I was probably only 3 so not reeeally an appropriate age nor is there any real reason to justify her touching me. 

That then opened the flood gates to all sorts of memories, like her showing me how nipples get hard by tickling mine, or showing me what adult pubes looked like by showing me hers. We also used to shower together which is normal for young kids but I have a feeling it went longer than the usual age, like maybe up until 8 or so? Grey area as to whether that’s weird in and of itself but definitely part of a pattern of weirdness. 

Something that’s been really bugging me is that I used to get thrush a lot as a kid and she would apply the thrush cream for me, I also used to break out in hives on my bum which she would apply cream on. I think this happened a few times between the ages of 5-9 or so. I remember lying on my bed and her applying the cream and my dad standing nearby looking really uncomfortable, as though he sensed that something was amiss. I still don’t really know if that element of her touching my body in that way is acceptable or not, or if she should have just been showing me how to put the cream on myself? I also used to get UTIs frequently in primary school which is obviously diagnosed through urine tests and treated with antibiotics, but she would always deem it necessary to examine me down there before taking me to the doctors about it. She also would tell me off for wearing underwear to bed and insist that I sleep with a nightie and no undies, but I’d always refuse because I felt too exposed in a way that made me feel unsafe. She also had naked photos of me as a kid (bathtub photos or something) that she’d often bring out when guests were over to show them which would absolutely humiliate me. 

She also would often try to talk about sex and masturbation with me, from a very young age. I remember being 9 or so and her asking me if I’d had sex yet, and me being bewildered by the question and her saying something like ‘I don’t know, I thought maybe one of the boys at school might have had sex with you in the toilets at school or something!’ And I was like.... what the hell ? I also remember the first time I had a crush on someone, I was 12 I think, I slept hugging my pillow pretending it was my crush (lol) and my mum found me like that in the morning and was overly interested in it and like visibly excited, asking questions like ‘ooo did you have a sex dream’ and stuff like that which made me feel sooo gross. 

She also convinced me to let her shave my armpit hair when I was 13 or so, like a mother daughter bonding thing - unsure if that’s normal but it felt gross. She’d always be bumbling around in and out of the bathroom while I was in the shower or getting changed and would comment on my body, I remember her telling me I should shave my pubic hair. Our relationship really turned south when I began my teenaged years and started shutting her out and enforcing boundaries around my privacy. Her and my dads attitude completely switched from berating me for eating too much and being greedy with food, to berating me for not eating enough and shaming me for displaying disordered eating habits. She told me she’d kick me out of the house if I developed anorexia because it would bring so much shame on the family (and make her look like a bad mum basically). I haven’t mentioned my dad much but basically he was an extreme alcoholic, unemployed due to intense chronic illnesses that left him in physical pain a lot of the time, he had a generally hostile manner and wasn’t someone I could turn to for support or any kind of consistent emotional connection. 

Both of them would constantly put me down in passive aggressive ways, comment on my hair and makeup and clothing, act as though I was attention seeking and often really bluntly tell me that I was likely to get raped because of the way I dressed. This was something my mum did from when I was a kid too actually, would say things like ‘oh god, that man is undressing you with his eyes’ when we were at the shops and literally any random man so much as looked at me. She also would shame me for the clothes i wore as a kid and the food I ate, which only recently have I realised how ridiculous that is given she was the one clothing and feeding me?? 

I remember her telling me that if someone were to look through a telescope from a nearby apartment building, they’d be able to see me getting changed in my bedroom. I remember challenging her on it and saying why would anyone even do that, and her responding with ‘you’d be surprised how many pedophiles are out there.’ (Which I guess is true..... but like, hectic thing to say to a kid) 

I have a feeling her mum did this to her, as there’s a strong line of matrilineal abuse from mother to child going back several generations (my cousin did some research on this a few years ago). Basically it’s made me never want to have kids lest I somehow misguidedly perpetuate whatever cooked pattern drove my mum to behave that way! 

Anyway, I just wanted to share my story because I’ve been drawing a lot of strength from just laying it all out on the table, and also in case it helps anyone else recognise patterns of abuse in their own childhood that they may have blocked out. Reading people’s stories online, listening to podcasts, talking to friends about this stuff and seeing a psych that specialises in this area has been so so huge in my healing journey, and I hope reading this may bring someone piece of mind in believing the validity of their own pain from experiencing covert and overt incest abuse! 

And thank you so so much for reading this essay lol!

TL;DR: I experienced confusing instances of covert incest that I only started identifying as abuse recently, and had many memories resurface that were confusing to process involving my mum, and I hope other people can find their way towards healing and integrating painful memories too.
