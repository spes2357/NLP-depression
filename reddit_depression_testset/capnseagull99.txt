Yesterday was the 2 year anniversary of my mother’s childhood friend committing suicidal. Hard stuff. I feel sad for her and recognize the grief in this. She asked me to call so she could talk and I did and she just ended up screaming at me mercilessly at the top of her lungs and hanging up on me when I told her that wasn’t appropriate. Today all I’ve gotten was a text message in the morning about how she needs a break from me, and then tonight, texts about how she doesn’t want to speak to me anymore and a bunch of shit rooted in her deep anger towards me for not moving back to my home state to be with her while she comes off meds/ not letting her live with me/ not quitting my job, leaving my boyfriend, and the place I’ve lived for 5 years where I’ve built a life to stay and be her permanent caretaker. 

A taste: “It’s not some “mental illness” if you truly did your research you would see exposure to a narcissist & their abuse WILL MAKE YOU GO CRAZY & make you very sick. My fucking body gave out on me from stress!!! Everyone say back & treated me like I was diseased. Let me go homeless. I sat in the hospital time after time alone. Now, the same. Alone.” 

A. Never called her mentally ill. She is. But that’s all projection, I didn’t start that fire. 
B. Has labeled our whole family narcissists.
C. She would not eat and that is why her body was not well. 
D. She is abusive and our family made necessary distance in the interest of self preservation. 
E. She was never homeless. Had a bed waiting for her every single night at my grandma’s but did not like that my grandmother had started to hold her accountable for her abuse and other behaviors. 
F. Called 8 ambulances on herself this summer. All trips to the hospital proved nothing wrong with her.
G. Has blocked 90% of her friends and family. 

I’m feeling anxious because every time she blows up like this I fear her doing something stupid. I am trying to find peace in knowing that this is not my responsibility. I am trying to find peace in knowing that is the ONLY one that thinks I should sacrifice my happiness for her. I am trying to find peace in knowing that if she were to make a choice to harm herself it would be in spite of me not because of me. I’m trying but this is hard sometimes. There is no being rational with her, no reason, no understanding. She does not want to take responsibility for the trauma that she has caused me and other people. I’m so sad, y’all. This blows. I just want some relief.
I just had a really unpleasant conversation with my mom that has me really down in the dumps and shaken. I don’t understand how she can be so incredibly hateful to me. Our entire relationship is built on what I can do to make her life better. She told me that “obviously she was a terrible mom” since I am not in my hometown with her. I feel like I’m getting punished for moving away for school, and starting a life here. She went on about how I owe her closure for moving out literally almost 7 years ago, when I was 16. She says I don’t have the balls to tell her. I have told her. We’ve had these conversations and they end up being nothing other than gaslighting and abuse. It doesn’t matter how many times I tell her that it’s not healthy for me to discuss that time in my life anymore. She looks at that situation, where she would not speak to me, just scream and ignore me, so I moved out, and only sees herself. Not a scared and angry teenager who needed a mother and consistency, and I just think that’s incredibly selfish of her. Everything that comes out of her mouth is angry bullshit. I feel so nauseated by the fact that I genuinely do not have a mother. She went on to call my therapist terrible things and criticize my progress. I have worked so hard and made so many positive changes and I am so proud of my growth in therapy. 

I just feel really vulnerable. I wish I wouldn’t have talked to her today. I wish I had a different mom and that her side of the family didn’t exist in my life but severing trauma bonds is so exhausting and overwhelming. I feel like I am drowning.
