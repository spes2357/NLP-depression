TL:DR     I had a vision accompanied by a bunch of physical sensations that seems to be a memory of me being raped as a child around the age of seven.





Ok here’s the long version.

Context:

Most of my memories of recent times are dim, and the visuals are usualy hard to make out with the exception of whatever I was directly looking at.


At the age of 9 I started getting into pornography, and I quicky found myself looking for things similar to the memory. However I didn’t have the memory at the time.

Durring sex I dissociate, freeze up, and totaly loose my ability to speak.

When I was dating this guy I liked, I had a regular feeling of “ I need to let him have sex with me” even though I personally did not want to have sex with him yet. I felt like I needed to let him do it because he had taken me on a date.

I have missing memories, taht is to say most of my childhood. 

I have regular intrusive thoughts about abuse, I can’t keep it out of my head for long even though I don’t like thinking about it. My friends have said these are flashbacks as they offten come with me dissociating, and sometiems gagging and feeling very sick.


I have these sick fantasies related to my abuse, or at least what I think was my abuse. I feel very ashamed of them, I wish I didn’t have them because they are just disgusting.

When I’m in a sexual situating, like the first time I for sure had sex, I was totaly unable to say no or tell him that I felt unsure of it. We had sex and I dissociated the entire time. I don’t consider that particular event to be anything wrong on the part of my partner but I could be wrong.

I sometiems want intimacy, but when it comes to actualy doing it I have panic attacks.



Ok, I’ll now write out all the visions I’ve had. These are pretty scary and might be hard to read so if you do think you should read it, don’t.


1. I had a vision of being forced to preform oral sex on some man I didn’t recognize. Durring the recollection I could sorta feel pubes on my face. This memory was in third person, very strange for my memories. Age 7-9

2. I had a vision of me crying on the floor, clearly in the aftermath of a rape. Age unclear

3. I had a vision of some guy throwing me into my bed, and not letting me get away while trying to remove my clothing.

4. The most recent vision seems to be connected to the last one but I can’t be sure. It was a vision of me and said man totaly undresses with him forcing me to preform anal sex. In the vision I am crying and desperately trying to escape. I could feel all sorts of things sensory wise while it was happening, like his hands holding my arms down, the sheets on the bed, and some other things.




The last one came after a session of self administered EMDR therapy, my regular therapist told me taht it might bring up somthing like this.


So what do y’all think? I feel like it realy happened and I just need a seccond opinion from people who know more.


Edit: I’ve been dealing with way more depression over the last week, that’s when these visions started durring meditation.

It may also be good context that I was depressed and suicidal from at least the age of 12 to now. I’m currently medicated however
