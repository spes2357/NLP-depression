My bpd mother became obsessed with Catholicism during my adolescence and twisted teachings that were wholesome and healthy into means of manipulation. The rituals I was forced to abide by on a daily basis were ridiculous. Daily mass and weekly confession, hours of daily prayer recitation, holy images had to be worn under my clothing at all times, had to use holy water at the doorway of every room in the house. There was literal hell to pay with any minor slip up... and of course she wanted to know everything I said in the confessional. Sometimes fits of rage directed at me and my sibling would turn into her screaming at "demons" in her head. She still tries to use religion to guilt me. Even though I am able to recognize that this behavior is insane, it still triggers me and cuts deep. I'm working on finding a therapist who can help me work through some of this, and trying with all my might to remain NC (although I had a recent slip up that I'm mad at myself about). I hope someone out there can relate.
