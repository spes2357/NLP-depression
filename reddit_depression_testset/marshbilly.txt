Long time lurker, first time poster.  

A brief backstory: I have been NC with my uBPD Mother for ~16 years, until last fall.  My mother was a Witch type until recently, now I feel she may be a Waif.

She had a legitimately horrible childhood (dad was a narcissist and man whore, mom was probably BPD (and was an alcoholic), she was sexually assaulted by her brother and her parents KNEW ABOUT IT AND DID NOTHING).  Like, of course she has mental health issues.  I feel like she tried to do better than her parents, but maybe she did not have the patience or ability to raise kids.  Not to excuse her behavior, but just trying to understand her.

Growing up, I was the scapegoat and my sister was sometimes the Golden child.  At times, we both suffered every kind of abuse possible, and both have PTSD and health problems (yay, autoimmune diseases?)

My sister, who has been in contact with her most of the last 16 years, called to tell me about some escalating, incurable health problems Mom's been having.  (I asked to be kept in the loop if my sister was comfortable with that AND didn't feel like she was relegated to messenger or mediator between us.). Mom probably has less than a year to live. (My parents divorced more than a decade ago, thankfully).

I don't want to regret anything, so after consultation with my therapist, I decide to visit her the next time my sister goes.  Visit goes relatively well, my Mom apologizes for "everything" without going into any upsetting specifics, we talk about some fairly mundane things, have a few laughs, and then I head home.

It was validating to see that she was sick, and that this is not a scheme to get attention.  Then I felt guilty for feeling validated.

There is no contact-bombing from my mom when I get back, just a single email thanking me for visiting and giving me her phone number if I'd like to call.  I am not under any illusions that she is better/cured, I honestly think she is not well enough physically to exert an effort to hassle me.

I have wanted to email her a couple of times since my visit, but I am finding myself nearly paralyzed with guilt.  

I feel guilt because she is ill.  I feel guilt because of her childhood.  I was a difficult kid.  We lived in a horrible place and we were poor.  I haven't spoken to her in 16 years, and that was really wonderful.  And so on and so forth.

I have no idea how to convey this to her. Or WHY I want to tell her all this now.  To give her some empathy and validation (which I never got from her) before she goes?  To make myself feel better?  Both?

(Note: my therapist retired in the midst of this and I am trying to get in to see someone else, but it is taking forever).
