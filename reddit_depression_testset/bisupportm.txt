Hi,  
I was sexually abused as a child for 5 years and then I told my mother. Year after that I asked my parents to take me to a doctor again and I was given anti depressants and he said things which made it worse. I had to leave education and then start again. My girlfriend would make me have phone sex and then she left me and years later started saying all sorts of things. No one has been punished by law. One psychiatrist gave me wrong heavy medicines and then another continued and said things for which he should be punished. Meeting the abuser makes me uncomfortable. I have been asked to stay away from him and have been asking for compensation from him. I am bisexual and need those I can discuss all this.I need social support.   


Get a bisexual partner and move or something.. Message me if you can help or need it :)  
I had wanted some body who can understand it, be loyal and caring and I could be for them.
