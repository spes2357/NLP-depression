So my uBPDmom sent a text in the family groupchat that she’s having a health issue that may require surgery depending on how serious it is. And because we’ve been VLC/NC for the past 4 months I’m feeling a little guilt right now about not reaching out to her. I did text her in the family groupchat letting her know that I’m praying for her to have good health and she said thank you, but part of me feels like I’m supposed to be doing more?

Because I’m her only child, I’m so used to being overly available for her and rushing to her aid whenever things aren’t okay for her. But after we had a falling out 4 months ago which caused me to go VLC/NC with her, I haven’t been feeling that urge anymore even when finding out about her health issue.

I do love my uBPDmom despite the emotional/physical/verbal abuse that I dealt with while being under her care because we did have a lot of good and fun memories when she wasn’t being a Queen/Witch. And I don’t want anything bad to happen to her or her health. But at the same time I don’t feel comfortable reaching out to her privately. And if she were to end up in the hospital part of me feels like I’m obligated to check on her because I am her only child and all of our extended family lives states away including her mom. But the idea of talking to her/seeing her makes me so anxious to the point that I shake, feel cold, and feel weak.

I’m feeling a bunch of different emotions and I guess I’m just trying to find out if my feelings are valid or if I’m being cruel by not reaching out to her more? How do I deal with the guilt?
