I never went on a vacation while growing up so I'll just tell this story instead. My family and I (Father, Step mother, sister, two step sisters) all loaded up into our Chevy Astrovan to visit the zoo which was about an hour car ride from our house. I was around 12 at the time, my sisters were 10, 10, and 7. We were all excited to go but I was especially. I've always been fascinated and extremely interested in animals. I even brought a note book so I could write the random facts that are posted on plagues outside of each enclosure. Like I said I was hype. Anyway my father was an alcoholic, anytime we took a long car trip he would bring a small cooler loaded with beer. It probably held six to eight cans plus ice. We rode for about forty five minutes on the highway before stopping so dad could piss and you guessed it grab more beer. Just to let you know he didn't drink all of the beers from the cooler he and my step mother would share them. With that being said dad always seemed to race to finish his first so he would have more than my step mom. So at this point we're around 15 minutes or so from the zoo and we're excited. Nobody wanted to stop but dad insisted. He runs in gets his six pack and comes back. My sisters and I are talking about animals and what we hope to see at the zoo while my father backs out of the parking space. Suddenly we hear a loud thud and the van abruptly stops. In the first moments after the accident nobody realized what happened we all just kind of exchanged looks of shock. Dad struck another vehicle that was pulling into the parking space next to us, as he was backing out. The accident wasn't bad and no one was hurt. While my dad was talking to the other driver my step mom threw away the old beer cans and slid the six pack dad bought under the seat. There was a dumpster against the gas station that was only like four to five feet from the passenger side of the vehicle. The police came and didn't suspect my dad of being impaired. My step mom always carried tooth paste in her purse as well as chewing gum for this reason. The damage of the van wasn't severe enough to prevent us from driving it home. I guess dad just exchanged insurance information with the other driver and was free to go. I'm sure some police report was made too but I never asked anything about the situation. I just know what twelve year old me observed from inside the van while all the talking was going on. So after sitting in this van for close to two hours with my siblings and waiting nervously to see if my father was going to jail he finally came back. He just sat down in the drivers seat and stared ahead for a minute. Without speaking he finally put it in reverse and backed out. When we pulled out of the gas station he turned left instead of  turning right to head toward the zoo. We were familiar with the area and knew immediately that we weren't going. This trip was really a big deal for all of us. Us meaning the children. My sisters were crying and I was really upset. Not just because I wanted to go so badly but because my sisters were crying. I remember thinking about how he had robbed my sisters and I of this good time we were so excited for. Good times were pretty rare for us so this trip really did mean a lot. I ended up speaking up and telling dad that I thought he was selfish for drinking and how we could have been hurt. We just wanted to go to the zoo and like so many other things it was ruined by alcohol. This was the first time I ever stood up to my father and said something about his drinking. He didn't like this at all and it caused an uproar in the van. The two of us were yelling as my step mom tried to comfort my crying sisters and referee the yelling match. I guess dad eventually got tired of it and after threatening to do so he pulled the van over and busted my ass. We rode the rest of the way home in silence and haven't really talked about it since.
