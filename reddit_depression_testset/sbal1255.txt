TW : Child Abuse.

So, the story I'm about to tell is something that I've just realized recently how harmfull it was to my life as a whole, this is going to be a long post but I suppose most of the posts of this community are, since there is no easy way to get off our chests all the pain.

I'm a straight male who grew up in a very traditional family, my parents didn't had a good relationship and they divoced very early on their lives. Since I was very young they have put a lot of pressure on me to be succesfull on my career and never get married, since, on their opinion "women are made just to get pregnant of your and steal your money".

I was always a shy guy at school and didn't had much attention for my appearance, I aways thought that I was ugly and I would not find any partner for me. When I was 14 and I was still discovering sexuality my father had a terrible idea.

He said that it was about time for me to "be a man", so he decided to ask for an escort for me to lose my virginity. Since I was 14 years old I didn't had the maturity to think about that as something harmfull for me, and I was really afraid to say no because this will make me "less of a man".

The day had arrived and the girl arrived, she was about 25 years old and I remember that she was unconfortable with the situation as well, I don't blame her at all. I remember that this was my first experience at all and I didn't knew anything beyond drawings from vaginas at biology books or condom ads. 

After the whole thing happened, it took me a while to have my first sexual experience but it seems like I kept this episode stored inside my mind where nobody would see, even me. When people asked about my first sexual experience, I always said about the second one, without the escort, not the first one.

A lot of years have passed and most of my sexual experiences were pretty bad at all, I had experiences where I took all the necessary caution to avoid any unwanted pregnancy and even with this my partner experienced a delay on her period (it happened 8 times during the last years) which created a constant paranoia about pregnancy and lots of pressure that I might turn into the "man that abadons the child", lots of paranoia about performance and dick size, lack of empathy of some partners when I had mental breakdowns, and many other ones questioning any aspect of me as a male, like "you are a cute hetero male, stop that" or "the engineering major is such a toxic male thing" or "the type of music you listen to is such a straight toxic male thing", and it goes with soccer, beer, games and much more other aspects about me.

This whole thing made me feel ashamed of every aspect of my sexuality and personality, I don't masturbate anymore, don't feel attracted to anyone, I blame myself for enjoying PIV, for enjoying receiving oral, I'm paranoid that every aspect of myself might reproduce any form of toxic masculinity. I pretty much isolated myself.

And the world as a whole felt a little bit cruel to me, I had told this story to some of my partners and none of them got shocked or even identified this as abuse since it's hard to recognize that a man can me abused. If I tell this to any male friends that I know they will probably laught at me or say that they wanted to me on my shoes, I feel pretty alone in this problem.

The major problem for me is how my sexuality got "dead" after those episodes and after I revisited this episode on therapy, I really wanna feel horny again, but everytime I do, there is always that voice in my head that says that I am being a toxic male for doing that, because I was forced to me this toxic male when I was 14.

Thanks for reading the whole thing! and sorry for any typo (english is not my first language)
