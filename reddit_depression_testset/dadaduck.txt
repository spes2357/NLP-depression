This past year has been a rocky one for me and my uBPD mom. I'm newly pregnant, and really feel like no contact is what's best for me and my family right now. 

I've had a lot of realizations about my mom (through therapy and lots of reading) this past year, and she isn't really aware of any of it. She just thinks I'm being distant because she an my father got divorced a year ago. I tried to explain things a bit last summer, but it didn't really stick and I've realized more since then. 

This is where I'm looking for advice. I wrote a letter explaining exactly how I feel and why, noting how hurtful her manipulation, guilt tripping and emotional abuse was in the past. It's a long letter, and it felt good to get it out on paper. 

I'm not sure if I should send the email, or just go NC with no explanation. I think sending it would help her see why I'm making this decision, but like a BPD parent, she'll most likely just deny it in her head. Any advice or thoughts from people who have been here?
