I can't go into much detail right now but I may be forced to call CPS on uBPDMom. To my family, this will be considered the ultimate betrayal, despite it being the right thing to do.

I'm super fucking anxious. I barely know what I'm doing. Can anyone offer insight? What's the best way to handle CPS, and what should I expect? I'm compiling documentation, and I will be making the call with my therapist at my side. 

My uBPDMom manipulates people so well. I'm scared that if I call CPS, nothing will happen, except my siblings will probably be subject to more abuse and dysfunction, and I will be promoted to The Scapiest Scapegoat of all Scapegoats.
