Trigger warning: CSA details

I’ve been feeling really depressed lately (more than usual) and created this throwaway account to just.... I don’t know.... have an anonymous place to share my story and maybe get some advice. I’m totally broken and I feel like I’ll never be normal. No. Im actually convinced I never will be. My abusers gave me a life sentence and I’m seriously ready to just give up on life. I don’t mean kill myself I’m too much of a wimp to ever do that, but I’m definitely an alcoholic and just numb my life as much as possible. I don’t even feel like getting help for my alcohol use. Today is day 1 (again) to quit alcohol and I’m already just ready to say fuck it. I’ll just be an alcoholic until I drink myself to death. I just want to drink and sleep and avoid life. 

Anyway, here’s how I got to this sad lonely point in my life...

I’m currently a 36m. From the ages of 8 - 12 I was abused by my best friends parents. The thing is, I was never forced into anything. They took me in like a family member, groomed me, and by the time the abuse started I was a fully willing participant. I know many of you experienced force and pain and I’m so sorry for you. I actually enjoyed my abuse. I feel like I’m the only person like that and it gives me a great deal of shame. Who the fuck enjoys being fucking sexually abused?!? I still can’t wrap my head around it. This created a lot of problems in my life as you’ll see.

My friend, his younger sister, and myself were frequently told to do certain things with each other while they produced child pornography. I even knew at the time that pictures and videos of me were being shared. At the time, I loved it. They made me feel special. I was the center of attention. I loved my abusers more than I loved my own parents. They made me feel good. To this day I have no idea where those hundreds or thousands of pictures and videos ended up. This was before the internet so I hope it never made it online, but the helplessness of not knowing makes me feel re-victimized every fucking day.

I became absolutely addicted to the abuse. Anytime I went to their house, which was multiple times per week, I would hope it would happen and sometimes literally beg to “play.” This went on for 4 years. I won’t get into all the details but we were involved in things no kids that age should be involved in with each other as well as with my friends parents. Not to mention the incest that was going on in that family.

When I was 12 years old, they moved away and the abuse stopped. It was a nightmare. I was so addicted to sex and crazy sexual behavior (things like bondage and exhibitionism and other really fucked up things a 12 year old shouldn’t be addicted to let alone know about). 

All the sudden, I had no outlet for these urges, and I started acting out. I began exposing myself to others or taking my clothes off in my bedroom with the light on knowing anyone could see in my window or stripping naked in risky places... weird shit like that. I was masturbating multiple times per day and it still wasn’t enough. I was obsessed.

Eventually, my whole world came crashing down. When I was 13 years old, I talked a couple 7 year old neighborhood kids into playing a game of doctor. I was the patient and was naked while they were clothed and “examined” me. I was very manipulative about the entire thing and think about those poor kids (adults now) all the time. The shame and humiliation from that is incurable.

Well, I got caught in the act by their father. He nearly beat the shit out of me but instead the cops were called. I was arrested for Aggravated Criminal Sexual Abuse which is a felony. I was pulled out of school, sent to juvie until my trial date (where I was sexually assaulted/groped in the shower by one of the guards but that’s another story), and was on probation/court ordered therapy until I was 17. That included group therapy with people who legit raped kids. I hated every second of it. Thank God I was a juvenile as I don’t have to register as a sex offender. Thank fucking god.

That arrest and the fallout from it fucked me up more than anything else. By the time I returned to school word got out about why I was out of school. For the next 5 years of my life I might as well have been walking around with pedophile tattooed on my forehead. High school was horrific for me. I can’t even explain the mental and physical anguish my classmates put me through. Maybe I just got what I deserved. But I was totally alone. Nobody wanted anything to do with me except harass me. Every single day was an anxiety filled mess where I constantly had to watch my back. Even the school losers wanted nothing to do with me. I’d just sit at a lunch table by myself as people through pieces of paper at me that said “child molester” on it. Fuck. I don’t know how I got through that. I’m crying as I write this.

I brought shame and humiliation to my family, my neighbors were rightfully worried if I harmed any other kids (rightfully so) and would send us death threats, etc. I wanted to kill myself so bad. My mother is the only reason I’m still alive. I just couldn’t do that to her. But my life was nothing but pain and I had nobody. No friends, just... nobody.

At that point, I went from being sex addicted to having PTSD and I’ve never recovered. I’ve been with only two women since my abuse and it didn’t go well either time. I just get panic attacks and can’t perform. It’s not enjoyable at all for me. I don’t even like being touched (or touching) let alone being intimate in any way. I’m essentially asexual.

So here I am.... a singe 36 year old alcoholic that can’t have a healthy sex life and can’t stop reliving the shit life I’ve had. The only sexual relief I get is masturbating where I think about my past abuse, then as soon as I’m done I feel immediate shame, humiliation, and dive right back into depression. Day in and day out. I will never be normal. I will never experience love. I will never feel true romantic intimacy. I just wish sometimes a meteor would fall from the sky and take me out to end this sadness, pain, guilt, shame, and sorry excuse of a life.

Again I’m not really sure why I shared my story here. For some reason reading some of your stories made me feel like sharing it would help me feel better. Sorry if this was TMI or if I triggered any of you. I just don’t know how to deal with this pain any longer. I just want a glass of whisky right now to just numb me up again and I haven’t even been sober for 24hrs yet. How the fuck am I going to do this....
