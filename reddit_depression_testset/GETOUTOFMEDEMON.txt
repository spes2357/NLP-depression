I grew up fairly poor never on welfare but things were always tight and my parents never made a secret of it. We were never hungry but there wasn't anything left over. So no vacations, had to miss out on some field trips free school lunches.

Anyway I went to college and now have a low-level job working for a politician (I am nobody important and I don't work for anybody important). It's the kind of field that attracts alot of really rich people, and so all the girlfriends I've had since college have all been from really rich families.

It's always been an issue for me even when they're really good to me and great people. I just wish they could relate to my stories like if I say my dad used to hit me she'll think it was child abuse instead of discipline. Or she'll off-handedly say something like "Every kid needs to see Europe" or something. A series of really small assumptions that get made that can hurt.

Anyone got a trick for getting over this?
