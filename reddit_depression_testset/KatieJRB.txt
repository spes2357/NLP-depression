uBPD mothers don’t change

My uBPD mother has been trying to control my life for as long as I can remember and today I made hat feel bad about it. In December 2018 I left home (aged 16) after I got to mentally ill from all of her emotional abuse. So she apologised ( after she is yelling and screaming so I defend myself) so what she did was change her netflix names to “inutile mere” which translates to “useless shit” (ps my sisters middle name is mere...). After a few weeks I come back home and ofcourse things go back to exactly how they were before. 

I got fed up again and left again late December last year and I moved in with a friend. I actually learnt a lot living there, I got better with cleaning up after myself and others. I also got a lot healthier in more than one way. My relationship with my mother got 10 x better. However, My friend and I kind of broke up for a bit and I had to go back home. Once again, everything went back to exactly how it was before. My mom just has more to use against me now. She keeps pulling the “I thought you changed” card when it comes to being clean. She just demands respect from me and doesn’t reciprocate. She is being hypocritical and ignores my privacy. But today, while I was at my fathers house, I get a text from my sister saying she was in my room and yelling about my room being dirty. So I texted her saying if she wants to be respected she has to respect my privacy. And she sent back a massive paragraph about every little thing wrong with my room- half of it being wrong- so I sent back a message saying how I was grateful for her to buy a house however, the amount of respect of me and my privacy would affect how much she would be apart of my life. She saw that she was wrong and started being “fed up” because this whole thing was “ridiculous” 

I sent my sister screenshots and then learnt that my mother had yelled at her for telling me she was mad about my room. I immediately sent another text and I ripped into my mother for yelling at my sister. She’ll probably end up being like “oh I told you girls you would all get along when your older” or some dumb shit to make it her accomplishment. But she has not replied. 

For once I don’t feel guilty about retaliating.

My mom is a cat lady
But she is crazy.
