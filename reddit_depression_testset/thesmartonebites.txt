Apologies for any typos just rage typing on my phone as I have been angry/stressed all day at work. 

At least once or twice a week I get this same song and dance over the simplest things and I have yet to break myself of the participation. 

Back story: every weekend to give myself a break from uBPD mom nonsense I stay with my boyfriend whom she despises, despite him being the loveliest and most supportive/understand person and having no experience in dealing with abuse/trauma/mental illness. But obviously he’s garbage because he isolates me and forces me to spend time with him, and of course she projects her own abusive and manipulative actions onto both of us. 

Unfortunately due to restrictions at his apartment I am unable to bring my dogs with me when I stay with him. However whenever I am able to bring myself to a place where I can leave my living situation guilt free they’re coming! But in the very least despite my mom’s shortcomings she does take care of them while I’m not there. 

So my mom asked me a couple of weeks ago if I would be able to take them with me for one weekend in May while she has some obligation. Which I told her was fine because it should be okay for just a weekend. 

Despite me confirming this she constantly brings up the fact that we are being inconvenienced by having them stay there (even though I would want them full time) and always uses excuses that allude to my BF not wanting to be inconvenienced by caring for them. Even though long term the plan is to bring them when I leave. She also frequently mentions how I would be screwed if I didn’t have her to help take care of them and we should be grateful for her help. Always follow by “even though you hate me at least I’m good for something” or “you should be thankful I do so much for you”. 

She also went into an apology about how she inconveniences me with simple tasks and how immature I am despite me never having complained about a single thing she asks. She apologizes if asking me to do things makes her an “abusive monster”. I’m talking basic things such as a ride to the grocery store. 

This happens with an assortment of other things. Despite her nastiness I should be grateful for what she does. I’d be screwed if I didn’t have her. When in reality I’m just plain sick of it and the nice things she does do aren’t worth it.
