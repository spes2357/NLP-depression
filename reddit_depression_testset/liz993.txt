Hi Everyone! 

I made a post a bit ago about being afraid to engage in intimacy because of my previous abuse. I ended up taking it down not because of bad responses but fear. My boyfriend and I were friends for about a year. I'd refused to catch feelings but I did regardless. I was terrified of my feelings and began going out on dates because he expressed interest in someone else. He heard about my dates and began to withdraw. He asked me out and I said yes. I was terrified because he's the first person I've genuinely liked. We went out and I realized I really liked him. I made it a point to talk to my family about it but because of my abuse they didn't want me to see him. I'm seeing him regardless. I told him about my abuse and he didn't care. He told me he wouldn't run and we'd take it at my pace. I was in charge. I fell in love with him and ended up having sex. I like to think of it as my first time because I don't count my abuse. He used me, I did not consent. I didn't give myself to him. He took something I didn't give. My boyfriend make me so happy, and makes me feel like I'm not hurt on the inside. He's offered to sit in therapy with headphones in and his offer has made me open to the idea of therapy again. I love him and only hope to be the best version of me for both of our sakes. I just wanted to share a happy story, among all these stories. Maybe somebody here needs it? Thank you everyone for helping me with my dark times.
