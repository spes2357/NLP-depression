Hello, everyone. I recently discovered this sub-reddit because I was looking for ways to deal with my abusive mother. I was hoping to get some answers from you guys... because truly, I'm at my wits end. To make things more clear to understand, I'll give a background story of where this all began.

So, back in 2017, I had a boyfriend. And he was my boyfriend for a year. Right from the get-go, I knew something is... *off* about him. It's that type of strange that pulls you in, and you can't help but get addicted to. But things turned south real quick. He has severe anger issues that is triggered when I didn't give in to what he wanted. He's emotionally, verbally, and mentally abusive; he is an A-grade gaslighter and manipulator, and proud of it!

However, the cherry on top of all of this is that he also sexually took advantage of me. He'd harass me, break me down both emotionally and mentally to the point of exhaustion in order for me to just give in to the sexual demands.

Thankfully, with whatever strength left in me, and that fateful meeting with a foreign therapist that saw me crying during my bus ride, I gathered absolutely every ounce of power in my being to leave him. The therapist told me that my boyfriend might have *narcissistic personality disorder* based on the symptoms that I'm showing; they were the symptoms of someone who was abused by someone with NPD. Then again, she also mentioned that she wouldn't be able to set the diagnosis in stone because she has to be able to meet and speak to my now ex-boyfriend personally.

Fast forward to a couple of months, I felt something... *off* about the house, and the general aura of the people in it. But nothing seems out of place and things are the way they usually are; my mother and I would still have violent fights, she would still assault me from time to time, and I still walk on eggshells in every waking moment I have in her presence.

I just can't shake off the feeling that someone in the house keeps reminding me of my NPD ex-boyfriend. After all the haze that clouded my mind for 23 years, I finally found the ultimate source of my misery. I found the reason why I was wired the way I am wired today. I found the person that became my first-brush to cluster B personality disordered people. *It was ultimately my mother*.

And by God, or whoever is up there, a damn light bulb shone so brightly over my head it burst. Everything just fell perfectly into place. The missing pieces of the puzzle are now found! The reason why I was attracted head-over-heels to my narcissistic ex-boyfriend is because I found the same treatment at home. That's the only understanding I have... that people who treat me the way my mother treats me loves me. Every single thing I suppressed over the years, from my childhood 'til today, came into play. The very first memory I can recall is when I was about four years old, and my mother was demonically shouting at my face, the TV volume was cranked up to a hundred, and she has a rubber sandal on one hand to beat me with. Just to list everything I can remember, here are her abuses:

1. Regular beatings; with belts and belt buckles, slippers, thin hangers, brooms, her hands, cooking pans (to hit me with on my body). This is when I wouldn't follow her orders.
2. Verbal lashings: I was 4 when she started calling me stupid and idiot, 10 when she calls me ugly and hideous, 13 when she first called me a bitch, 15 when she called me a whore and a slut for thinking I let boys see my body (note: I was studying in an all-girls school at that time), 18 when she regularly used the nickname *stupid bitch* to call me or to get my attention, etc.
3. I was 17 when she first threatened to hurt me with a knife. She pressed the goddamned thing to my stomach, and taunted me about what I'm gonna do about it now.
4. She cut up all my clothes with kitchen scissors. And when that's not enough, she'd throw my clothes out on the streets for me to pick up one-by-one.
5. She spat on my face *twice* in my entire life, while beating me just because she escalated a banter going on between me and my sister that's got absolutely **nothing to do with her**. She just escalated the fight unnecessarily.
6. She has a thing about cooking for everybody. I am **not allowed to cook anything for myself**. If I am to cook anything, I'm supposed to cook for everybody else in the house.

One last thing is that she is also sickly. She has all sorts of illnesses that she constantly talks about around the house to illicit compassion and empathy from other family members; especially from me. And if I don't respond to her call for help and compassion, she would call me ungrateful, and selfish, and would guilt-trip me big time about how she took care of me when I was sick or when I needed her help.

Now that I know my mother is the Queen/Witch type, can someone give me tips on how to deal with her? I cannot leave the house because I have a younger sister that deals with my BPD mother at the same time, and leaving her behind is like throwing her in the wolf-den. I don't have enough money to move out yet, and I don't live in the US... so any sort of social worker help is not available. Any advice would be highly appreciated. Thank you so, so much for reading my long story. And I am so sorry for the long read. (I tried to compress 23 years worth of vent in this post.)
