Anyone who has experienced childhood sexual abuse (incest) in a romantic relationship now? Did that really distort healthy boundaries or the whole concept of what a healthy relationship is? I am trying to relearn. It's hard to wrap my head around how a person (parent, caregiver, etc) who was suppose to protect you and be there when needed did not but instead violate and cause harm which can lead to internal turmoil for the developing young child. 

I am in a limbo. I am extremely avoidant and am closed off. I am in therapy and I know it's going to be a process. I do know trauma is marked in our biology and with ptsd it can be like it's happening all over again. Also, not being able to trust anyone is always a factor. 

I'm also wondering if I should take sometime to really just work on myself because at times I do feel like I am using a romantic partner as a distraction which can trigger anxiety and all that other stuff.  I may have some codependency issues as well. 

I have taken MANY steps forward and hope to continue down that path. I feel like a lost cause when it comes to dating and intimate relationships.. curious if anyone is willing to share their experience.
