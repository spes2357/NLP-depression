content notes: childhood sexual abuse, accountability, maintaining relationships

&#x200B;

nearly a year ago, my sister reached out to me to open up a conversation about our childhood. she sexually abused me from when i was six to eleven (she's five years older than me). predictably, she was abused as a child by our maternal grandfather. he may have abused me, too, i don't remember. i love my sister very much and i'm committed to maintaining a relationship with her. there's so much to our childhood: her issues with anger management and physical violence (mostly towards herself), her eating disorder, my eating disorder, her suicidal tendencies, my suicidal tendencies.... but at the beginning of everything, there's the sexual abuse. i never intended to talk about it with her, but i'm glad that she brought it up and opened this conversation, because i feel closer to her than ever before, and i feel more capable of managing my demons than i ever have been. it's been extremely destabilizing and challenging though: about a month after she opened up the conversation between us, she uncovered memories of our maternal grandfather abusing her, and shortly thereafter, attempted suicide again and did a six week stint in an inpatient program. shortly after, she disclosed our maternal grandfather's abuse of her to our parents.  in the fall, i visited her, and that went really well (if you can call it that; immediately after my partner and i left her house, i threw up involuntarily).  also in the fall, with my sister's blessing, i disclosed what we've been talking through to our parents. it's possible that my mom was also abused by her father -- he was absent during most of her childhood, and she, like me and my sister, doesn't have a lot of memories of being very young. my sister's relationship to my parents has suffered tremendously after these disclosures. they believe her, and they believe me. they have a lot of love for us both, and support the work we've been doing on our relationship, but i think they fear saying the wrong thing, and as a result of that, they haven't actually shown much support. i suppose i have few expectations of competent emotional support from my parents, because they've been unable to give that to me in past times when i've disclosed being sexually assaulted and raped -- but for my sister this is all new, even the memories of child abuse are new to her, whereas i've had many years to get used to the memories. 

anyway, all that's really backstory. the reason that i'm writing here because i am wondering if there are other people who have pursued the path of honesty and reconciliation with their families, and what that looks like after year one. i feel very alone and vulnerable when i say that i love my family and that i'm committed to being in relationship with them -- there are so few models out there of people sexually harming each other and maintaining the relationship. i fear that people will doubt how seriously i was hurt because i still embrace my family. i lean hard on transformative justice, so much so that i've contributed to public resources around community accountability. i feel capable of the journey ahead of me, and i can sense so much that it's the work of decades, not years.  i really would love to know that there are other people out there who are on this path, or who have come to a place of peace about it. thank you for reading this, i normally am the kind of person who would then go through and edit and re-edit what i've written to be more concise, more accessible, etc., but i'm doing my best to practice messiness and generosity so here it is!
