My boyfriend of five years is proposing to me this summer, and I’ve been thinking a lot about what I want my wedding to look like. And I realized that I don’t want one. My mom is a queen/witch (aka, a complete monster) and I don’t want her around for my wedding. Even if she didn’t “act out” all I would worry about is her. 

It would have to be a dry wedding, but she might just sneak in her own booze. It would take a lot of fun away from everyone else and they all would know why it had to be a dry wedding. Everyone knows she’s an addict at this point so she doesn’t try and hide it anymore. She will for sure steal the microphone during the reception and say something really messed up. 

She’d abuse my dad all day. I’m worried she’d ruin the father/daughter dance by dramatically storming out, screaming obscenities at him, etc. She’d probably stomp on his foot or pinch him when no one was looking. He’s on a blood thinner so it would swell and hurt really bad, she did it at my brother’s high school graduation. He’d have to pretend to be happy along with me. I’m sure we would both end up crying throughout the day, and they wouldn’t be happy tears. 

I’d be meeting a lot of my boyfriend’s family for the first time and she will make me look like white trash. My future in-laws would be miserable having to pretend to like her. And then there’s everyone else. My bridesmaids, my friends, my colleagues, everyone else. I just can’t do it. 

I’ve always wanted a wedding, but I’m not going to have one. She will mess it up. It really, really hurts. Most little girls spend a lot of time thinking about their “perfect wedding day,” and I was one of them. It’s just one more thing I’ve had to let go of. 

I’ll probably get married at a courthouse and announce it on Facebook. One time I joked to her about doing that and she started sobbing, because how could I take “her only daughter’s wedding day away from her!” And the more I think about that, the more it hurts.
