I needed to share this because...it was just one of those things that you can't share with loved ones but feels like you need someone else to see it. Sorry if it's too much...(I'm looking at the post now...lol it's a lot.) It doesn't need to be read...it just needed to exist.  Many thanks <3

I don't know if it will help anyone else struggling to realize how the word 'abuse' fits in to their upbringing. I very much disassociated my childhood and so I'm behind the ball on understanding the situation fully. I read a lot of posts on here, acknowledging and accepting what happened as abuse. I could relate but would say to myself..."but what happened to me wasn't abuse...It didn't hurt me that much". Delusional way of thinking I know. I'm starting to see why I think that though...how exactly it was groomed.

>“**You don’t really understand the situation**....” “**There was a lot going on in her life**....” **“It's okay because she was doing the best she could**...”

These statements are part of my every day. These statements are what I told myself as a child, what I tell myself now, and what I tell others anytime I let slip an abuse I endured from my mother. Abuse is new to me. Not the word but the idea I was abused. It’s a tough concept for me to grasp. My mom, she was abused. Me on the other hand, I know it to be true but it doesn’t “feel” true. My current deflection is...

>“**it’s more complicated than that…**”

Yes, I was physically punished, yes I was verbally destroyed and shamed, yes I was expected to bear the emotional frailty of a grown woman...but abused? No, I was doing my part to be what my mother needed because no one else could, because she was all alone. This is what unconditional love looks like. This is what you do for the ones you love, be a port in their storm.

Abuse was the stories my mom would tell me about her upbringing and past relationships. Abuse was sexual mostly. Abuse was quitting high school because home life was so bad. Abuse was having no family to turn to. Abuse was never having new clothes and being so neglected you almost die. Abuse was being beaten so badly you needed to lie down for days and cover up your face with makeup. Abuse was an escape in the middle of the night with your two year old in tow; afraid of the devil behind you. Abuse is being unloved.

When I was a child my mom bought me new clothes. She gave me hugs and told me she loved me, confided in me, and made me her best friend. My mom let me stay home from school if I was tired, helped me with school projects and took care of me when I was sick. My mom told me she’d do anything for me, told me she’d sacrifice anything for me.  My mom told me she trusted me, told me she put her children first in all her decisions. My mom told me I was kind and I deserved the world. My mom told me she was blessed to have me. My mom told me that she worked hard for me and she would always protect me. My mom told me she would always be there. *She was my saviour.*

When I was a child my mom threw things at me, destroyed the things she gave me in fits of rage, gave things I wanted to my brother and told me I needed less.  My mom called me disgusting, fa\*\*ot, filthy, slut, whore, dirty, b\*tch, arrogant, selfish, fragile, worthless, rude, cold, reta\*\*ed, weak, freak, mean, loser, embarrassing, ugly, cruel, weird, and spoiled. She kept me home from school when I was bad. She shared my secrets and shamed my need for privacy.  She beat me with metal studded belts, hit me with random objects, she pulled me out of bed by my hair, held me above the ground by my hair, held me above the ground by my neck, dug her nails into my flesh, rubbed dog pee in my face, slapped me across the face, spanked me in public, and kicked me in the legs. *She was my executioner.*

My mom made sure I understood what she sacrificed for me relentlessly . She reminded me loud and often. My mom said she was nothing like her mother. My mom made sure I knew I wasn’t abused, I was loved.

\*\* Thank you for the bottom of my heart. I have read all of your posts and seen my own pain reflected. I appreciate all that offered words of encouragement and those willing to share your own experiences, offering solidarity for something that is so isolating... Truly an amazing community.  Stay well <3 <3

*\*\*One more thing - Please do not use this post as an invalidation for your own abuse...we're all trained to go their in our heads, I know.  The abuse we all endured (****all types****) was hard to pin down because it was undermined by our parent's definition of what abuse is, being invalidated by our parent, and because of the rapidly changing situations we found ourselves in as children. How could we ever reconcile the monster and the angel in our minds? By thinking maybe the monster never existed...maybe it was all our misunderstanding because look, they took care of us sometimes...* 

*Emotional, psychological, and physical - it's all abuse. A club no one wants to be part of but nonetheless we are all part of... <3*
