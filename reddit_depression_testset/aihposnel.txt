Hey everyone,

while finally talking to my family again (from whom my mother separated me while having contact with her, meaning the last decade and in parts longer) I come to some horrifying information. 

First: it's hard for me to trust what my family is saying because of the constant lying of my mother. But, I have to be honest, what they are saying a) makes way more sense, b) they are telling more or less the same, so it's congruent and c) maybe not everyone is a fucking liar I guess. 

But listening to the stories about my mother, especially listening to my aunt (her sister) it seems that she lied about almost every major thing in her life. About her childhood (listening to my mother they had the worst childhood, were in foster care, a lot of abuse... Listening to my aunt: of course not everything was happygolucky but we were loved and cared for and no major issues), about her relationships (not  about who she was with, but about how they went down - i.e. she told me she got raped and that's how my older brother was conceived - turns out no. It was her highschool boyfriend, they were together after that, married, had a second child and then the marriage went downhill cause they were like 16 and totally overwhelmed. I mean I knew they had my second brother, but still I thought she told me she was forced to marry him - it didn't make much sense to me.) She lied about the men she was with, everyone was the devil. She lied about the abuse my brothers had to suffer from her second husband (while he was the devil she won't acknowledge the abuse my brothers endured). She lied about my father. She lied about how dangerous my family is. She lied about so many things, I cannot recall all of them. 

Now my question, maybe some of you can help me out here: is it lies or is she genuinely crazy, delusional, needing help? 

I know I am not in the position to help her, I told her before going NC that she needs help because of her behavior. I just want to know if it's common with BPD/Narcissists to literally rewrite your own life and that of your family. Or if this is (on top of it all) something else.

My theory: I know from my aunt (hopefully trustworthy) that she already showed strange behavior as a child. Like being mean, being spiteful and my aunt as well as their dad found it weird. Further I know that my mom was a "mum child" while my aunt was more of a "dad child". Maybe that's why they are so different? My mother had m oldest brother when she was 15 (I guess that was kinda traumatic for her). Her next husband was an abusive alcoholic, as far as I know from my brothers, who beat the boys and my mother wouldn't protect them (it's up for speculation why she didn't). My grandparents took my brothers in, while my mother stayed with this asshole some time longer. My aunt says that she thinks the guilt broke my mother and after that she went downhill and the compulsive lying, manipulating etc. Started. That was more or less 50 years ago. 

Is it possible to get in this (psychotic?) spiral from Cluste B disorders? Or do you think she is not really psyhotic but just lied and lied to herself and others until she believed herself? Because now it seems like she is fucking convinced of her storyline. I was too. Now I am majorly confused. And finally know why I have this huuuge fear of losing my mind. I mean shit, I saw my mom losing hers apparently ðŸ¤¯
