Sorry that I post too often and trash the thread, but this subreddit makes me realize things about my childhood almost every day. I think I will slow down now though.

Growing up I was not physically abused, but my uBPD mother a few times was a bit physical. I have been thinking about it for a few weeks now and I realized it that I find her behavior weird. Compared to my dad, who is a really nice person, she is kinda off. My dad never even raised his voice at us like ONCE and we were getting along just fine, never had to argue about a thing. But with my mother it was different. I know many of you had it way worse, and I always thought that spanking a child once or twice is very normal and doesn't cause trauma, but now that I think about it, my dad never did that so why did my mother then? I honestly think it was not necessary and I disagree with my mother that she did that. I am not traumatized by it, but I honestly would never do that especially to preschool children. My opinion is that kids who misbehave for attention often have problems at home and need attention from teacher so they can make sure the kid is not abused at home. IMO kids don't need abuse also at the kindergarten or school for misbehaving.

It all came up half a year ago when I had a job. I had to type a written transcript of an interview (for research purposes), and the grandma (in her late 70s) in the interview was a kindergarten teacher, talking about how it is a shame that society doesn't let them hit children anymore (so aged 3-6 in her care) when they seriously misbehave. My mother (in her late 50s) defended the grandma, saying sometimes kids do deserve it. She is a primary school teacher (for kids 11-14 years old), but as far as I know she didn't hit the kids though. But during this talk she admitted to me that she hit my brother on the face when he was 1 or 2 years old so he learns how to behave. I told her that I don't agree with her and I still remember the two times when she hit me when I was 4 and 5. She didn't apologize (I never heard her say sorry in my life) and I didn't think she would. 

Now I know that some people think spanking is okay, especially if it is the last resort and the parents explain to the child exactly why they are hit. But the thing is, I was not told why. One time my mother made fun of me (4 or 5 years old) and I told her to stop. She just laughed at me and I pushed her on her side to stop her. Next thing I know she looks at me with the most spiteful eyes, turns me over and hits me repeatedly on the bottom very hard. No explanation after that. It is one of my first few memories of my life. The next time was even more random. Besides these two events she never hit me again. But she does have a very loud voice when she rages. When I was 10, my brother got in trouble with the law (got a fine only though), and my mother threw plates. I hated that and was afraid to anger her that much. I did anger her eventually that much and she threw plates again when I was 23 and angered her, but I was not in the room though. 

I just find it very odd. To hit a toddler who was lying on his back? What could have my brother done so young to warrant that? And in my case it is also weird if I really think about it. I was born with a neurological disorder and I was not declared healthy until I was 10 (I had a normal childhood despite that though, I was one of the lucky ones with that disorder and made full recovery). Neurological disorders can have (smaller or bigger) effects on the brain (brain defects or even childhood mental illnesses) so my parents were afraid I would be mentally disabled if I don't get proper treatment. I was a bit awkward child (for which I was bullied a little), but besides that I was totally fine, and developed with very few issues (few speech problems and very-very mild dyslexia and dysgraphia that I got special education for). The times she hit me though were **barely** a year later since I got my 4th (and last) major surgery. One of them not even half a year later. Now it just creeps me out. Not only the spanking (though I do remember her eyes very vividly and I get scared even now when she looks at me with those eyes now as an adult), but if I had a sick child like that I would get worried not to pick on them because they can be neurologically impaired more easily than healthy children or sick kids with different disorders. I was physically fully healed from the surgery scars when she hit me, so it was not an issue, but I was still medically sick at the time. Kids with my disorder can get remissions out of the blue sometimes, that is life threatening if not resolved under 24 hours or os. I only had one when I was 3 but the risk is always there. Because I didn't have anymore I was declared healthy at 10. I think I was spoiled waaaay more due to my illness (probable reason for being the GC until I was 16 I guess), but still. She tells me stories how worried everyone was for me because I was sick. I kind of don't believe that now. Who would spank violently a child without explanation half a year later to a big surgery? I mean, I don't think I was traumatized by my illness, but IF I WAS, medical trauma (especially after sudden remissions and emergency surgeries) is a real thing. 15-20% of the kids get childhood medical PTSD because of remissions. I was an incredibly well behaved child, but if I was not, it could have also been because of the the illness. And it angers me to think that my mother sometimes treated my siblings badly even as primary school kids and I think she would have been willing to treat me that way if I was acting out (even if it would have been due to medical trauma from the surgeries and remissions or side effects of my neurological disorder). But she didn't because I was a very-very good kid -- until I was not anymore at 16. I don't know if I am explaining this correctly. It just kind of got me thinking what could my life have been if I have been a naughtier child or medically traumatized by my illness. Would she treat me worse, spank me more, or would I have got therapy instead? I just can't trust it. I know past is past, but it ruminate about it a lot.

I just don't get it. My dad didn't have to hit us once, we have a distant but nice enough relationship. Why did my mother had to then? I know twice is nothing, and I don't want to pretend that I was physically abused or something. But ever since that talk with my mother half a year ago I do think about the spankings from time to time and it was not horrible (my issues are with her raging at me and looking at me with those murderous eyes not the pain), and I know she would never hit me. But since she says sometimes kids deserve it, would I have been hit more if I was not so well behaved? 

Sorry, it got too long and very messy. It is very messy in my head as well.
