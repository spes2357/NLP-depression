(TW: self harm/suicidal ideation mention) 

I've been going through a lot of intense therapy and it's making me confront my relationship with my mom in a way I haven't done before. For context, I'm 26 F and an only child and I haven't had consistent commication with my mom in years. Pretty much every day I feel so, so, so intensely guilty that I don't speak with her. When I have called her it was usually just a way to try to feel less terrible with myself. Which obviously never works. Even if things seem fine at first it inevitably ends with her returning to the same patterns with me. Where she's being hurtful or having me take care of her. 

With all the therapy, I've been remembering things I haven't really thought of in years. Mostly just how things use to be before it got bad when I was around 11 to 12. I remember a year where I was homeschooled and I would spend every day with her and I felt comfortable. My mom was cool to me, she was someone I wanted to emulate, and I remember feeling like she was my friend on some level. The only really negative thing I can remember was realizing my mom was depressed and wanting to do something about it. As I got older I feel like I saw that version of my mom ( that I think of as being relatively consistent and positive) less and less and instead got all these really extreme and jarring versions or her. Like where she'd get extremely rageful and unload onto me in these bouts of emotional/verbal abuse. I can't remember a lot of the details of what would be said during those moments. I just remember being really unable to escape from her terrorising me and the constant fear that she would get angry. And moments when she'd use me for emotional support and would come to me crying even though I was just a teen and couldn't handle those things. Or when she was acting super weird (which I didnt always realize was her being drunk) and being completely incoherent with me or with sometimes our extended family or my friends. 

I know it's good for me to assert my boundaries with her and continue to not speak to her. She really just fucks with my head. She doesn't take responsibility for herself or her actions. But I still feel so intensely guilty. Like I'm just a terrible person for abandoning her. Even when she's leaving me bullshit voicemails saying "for once" she needs me. As if she has ever really been there when I truly needed her. I feel like because I remember deep down who my mom was to me before everything got so bad it's so hard for me to let go of this idea of her returning to normal someday. Even though I KNOW it won't happen. And I think on some level the person I thought she was didn't really exist. I feel like she warped me into being a person that existed for her and not for myself. And that maybe I just let it happen because I wanted really really badly for her to be normal again? I know I've been traumatized by our relationship. I know it causes me to dissociate all the time. I'm afraid and anxious of everyone I know. I have struggled with self harm for years and I have suicidal thoughts all the time. But I still just feel like I'm full of shit? Like that everything wasn't as bad as I'm making it out to be. And that even if it was - who cares when my mom is actually suffering all the time. Even though I know I'M suffering. But to me, my suffering and her suffering are almost the same thing. 

I've been working really hard on my own self esteem and I've made up my mind about not breaking and calling anymore. But jesus christ I don't feel like a functional person at all. Every day I just feel so weighed down by all this responsibility I feel and all the guilt. It makes life seem pointless to have watched my mom become this person and to be able to do nothing about it. It feels impossible to get up each morning. I wish I could just move on but it feels like a huge part of me is back home and it never left and I don't know how to get myself to just leave already. And I'm so afraid the people I love will leave me because I genuinely do not know how to stop feeling so depressed and awful. Im at this point now where it's so hard to feel any joy at all. I just wish I could be better on some level. Even though I know that's fucked. That I had the capacity to be there for my mom and that I could be normal and not so ridiculously depressed for the people around me now. I just want to apologize for who I am all the time.
