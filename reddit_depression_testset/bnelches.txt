As you get older, I know that you can lose a lot of memories from your childhood. The smaller details in between larger life events or more impactful memories. I’m wondering how much loss of time/memory is “normal” and what’s possibly related to my abusive upbringing.

I’m 30 years old and I can honestly tell you, I have almost no linear memories from between the ages of about 9-13. I have some traumatic memories of abuse and other harmful incidents from that time period that are burned in to my brain but nothing I could put on a time stamp on. I couldn’t even begin to guess how old I was at the time they happened, I just know they happened within that 5 year period based on the memory I have from before and after that 5 year window of time. I don’t remember hardly anything about school, birthdays, vacations. Couldn’t tell you much about what my bedroom looked like or what I was doing for fun or anything at all... I don’t have any real concept of time, it’s very strange.

Is this normal? I have no idea if this is how normal memory works or not.
