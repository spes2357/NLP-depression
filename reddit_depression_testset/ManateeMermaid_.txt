So, my parents divorced in 2000, and I lived with uBPD mom. From 2000 on, my mom fantasized about my dad dying so state would pay child support, since he didn't pay much. Eventually she started gloating to me that if she ever wanted to, she had friends who offered to play hitman and kill him, or take out his knees. She met with these people and formally heard them out.

She kept making friends with gang members, so over the next 14 years she'd share about the latest person she met who was willing to do a dirty deed when she wanted it.

I had a gut knowledge growing up that she was capable of killing me, and wanted to. She was severely physically and sexually abusive, so there were points where I calculated what Id need to do to kick her off of me at times and run away, but I knew she would escalate to potentially killing me. She always made it a point that if I resisted her abuse, she'd come back at it 10x worse. 

The week before I ran away from home in 2013, she told me in a rage that I was the biggest mistake of her life, and it'd be better if I didn't exist.

I asked her if she meant that, the day I ran away. She'd often say horrible things and immediately forget. She very cooly told me that she meant every word, and that she really truly wishes I never existed.

I had spotty contact with her since running away, while I was still in the FOG, but have been NC for several years. 

I live just 30 min away from her house, and realized recently that I always feel a deep anxiety because I know deep down that she really wishes I were dead, that she has the contacts and means to do damage to me, and knows that all it would take is a trigger for her to set her off. An example of an impending trigger is, she's always bemoaned not being in her parents will, so my uncle received a large inheritance, and my elderly, ill uncle told me and my sisters that he plans to pass it to us when he passes. My body knows I'm not safe so long as she's alive and around.

I'd love to hear your stories on navigating this. I know that if I took out a restraining order, that would be a trigger for her to retaliate big time. 

I pretty desperately want to move far away from her, but also want to stay so bad because I have my sisters and best friends here, and its an ideal area for my career.
