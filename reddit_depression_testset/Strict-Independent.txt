Hey all, been NC with my uBPD mom for about 7 months now.  It's been a god send for me not to have to deal with her crazy, but my non-BPD father still is in contact with her, so I still hear about her all the time.

Currently, they are figuring out whether they want to stay together or get divorced, but oftentimes my dad will text me about whatever fight they just got into.  At first when I went NC with her, it was great being able to finally talk about how awful she is with him because for so long we thought she was sort of crazy but ultimately normal.  Although, after a while (and with some help with therapy), I realized that confiding in each other and helping him navigate his issues with her not only was inappropriate given I'm his daughter, not his therapist, but also hearing about their troubles all the time it just was roping me into a fight that should just be between them.

I have told him in the past many times that I don't want to hear about the specifics of their fights because it's inappropriate and I'm not his therapist, but he keeps disregarding those boundaries.  The other night he called me almost in a full blown panic/meltdown saying that "you're the only one who understands what she's like" and "I just need to hear that this is not my fault" (referencing the divorce).  I saw him a few days later and, still totally distraught, he venting to me for a few hours about all their fights, etc. again.  I felt awful about how he's doing right now given my uBPD mom has been especially evil the past few weeks so I just couldn't find it within myself to remind him of the boundaries and just tried to comfort him.

But last night I got a few texts from him screenshotting text messages from her and asking for advice, and I finally responded that I didn't want to get involved in their fights and he didn't respond to it.  I feel terrible because I feel like he is really needs support (I'm not sure if any of my other family members have had a ton of time to be there fore him) but on the other I don't want to be my dad's therapist (especially when I've got issues of my own with him enabling her emotional abuse all my childhood).  Does anyone else struggle with this with their non-BPD parents?
