Saturday was my moms(abusive alcoholic) memorial. It was a hard one for many reasons for me. It had my real dads(addict) family, my step dads family(emotionally abusive alcoholic), my moms family who had no idea she was an alcoholic until she died of it. It was all held at the Mormon church because of my step family. I attended for a few years, and when home was really bad a lady from there let me stay with her a while. She was there too. 

My poor husband who I met after I was more stable got thrown into the craziness. Got to see first hand the abuse I couldn’t escape, got to see all the enmeshed jerks. What really pissed me off though, not my struggles because I knew they would be there, but how they treated my husband. He was so upset. My stepdad made fun of him, squeezed  his neck in a weird way and made aggressive comments. My step grandma martyred herself and was mean all day. You know those little remarks that are covert jabs in your confidence and heart? Ewwww. My dads family was actually nice, but left quick. My moms best friend was vile. Another one drunk.

It’s just so glaring how far I’ve come with acceptance. How not normal it is through my husbands eyes. The abuse was real. It still is there. Going back to low to no contact now. We are not safe there. I’m so sad. We are supposed to help with some estate stuff. I’m not doing it now for fear my stepdad will cross too many lines. I might lose some sentimental stuff, but I love my husband more. I love me more.
