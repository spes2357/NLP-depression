Hey all, 

This is gonna be a mini rant at the unfairness of life...

A little background: BPD mom, diagnosed during a legal mental eval during the divorce. Ruined dad + me + my brother's lives through financial and emotional turmoil that she put us through. So while we suffer through her abuse, live in poverty (yeah, all her lawsuits, court objections, etc regarding the custody battle really drained us), she is living what looks like the high life .

She found a new bf, lives off of his/her mom's money, doesn't have to work, lives in a nice house, goes on vacations, etc. 

I know I've mentioned this before but this just bothers me so much. It's just so unfair how she's continuing her antics, making us suffer, but stil living what seems like a great life. Are people with BPD actually happy? What do they feel?
