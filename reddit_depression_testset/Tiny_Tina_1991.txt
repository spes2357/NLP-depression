I was only 7 when I was first molested by my mom’s boyfriend. I’m 29 now. He was sneaky enough to not get caught for over a year. He was finally found out when my grandma found bruises on my inner thighs. They were actually hickies not bruises. He also molested my three brothers as well. My eldest brother is openly gay and still has night terrors of the abuse that happened over two decades ago. My second brother has anger issues. He was the only one who fought back and was physically abused because of it. My younger brother seems quite normal considering he was too young to remember any of the abuse. This one diabolical man ruined our lives. Unfortunately he did not even serve much time in jail for what he did. It was like a few days in jail with probation. He eventually reoffended and was caught molesting his own nieces. My mom was bipolar, on drugs, and oblivious to what was going on. We ended up in foster care when my mom was stripped of her custodial rights. Our biological dads were both deadbeats nowhere to be found. 

My aunt was given custody of us. I was then being molested in my sleep by her husband. And verbally abused by my aunt. I was only 9. After three years of that, I ran away. I was found and was sent back home to my aunts again. I ran away again and ended back in foster care. My aunt never believed me about her husband and made me out to be a manipulative little slut. I was happier in foster care than I was with my own family. 

After a while, my uncle took custody of me. He was still young and struggling but was willing to give it a try. He actually spoiled me a bit. I was 13 at the time. He never tried anything funny with me but I always felt as if he was a little too friendly at times. But nothing bad ever came about it. It was actually one of his friends that started to give me extra attention. He would call and text me when my uncle was at work. He would buy me things and flirt with me. He did what a guy does when he’s trying to win a girls affections. Problem was I was only 13 and he was in his 30’s. He eventually got in my head and into my pants. At that point I was no longer that innocent little girl. I was, least I thought I was, in control of my body. I started flirting with other grown men. Sadly it wasn’t very hard to attract them. One day my uncle came home early and found me in the swimming pool making out with the neighbor. He was in his mid 20’s. The guy nearly had a heart attack and ran home. I thought my uncle was going to kill him. At this point my uncle was at his wits end with me. He threatened to send me to a group home if I didn’t change my ways. Mind you he still had no idea I was having sex with his friend. I ended up running away again. This time I went with a guy I met at the amusement park. He introduced me to his cousin who turned out to be a pimp. Not going into details, I was being trafficked at the age of 14. This went on for nearly 2 years. All I can really say is you don’t know what your husband, father, uncle, or grandfather is capable of! I was bought and sold like a piece of meat to these men of all ages. 

I was eventually arrested for solicitation and sent to a group home out of state. Never treated as a victim only as an offender. This is how we are treated. I was emancipated at age 17. Been through multiple bad relationships with both men and women. Yes I’m bisexual. I ended up using meth and was on a downward spiral. Then I met my husband. At first we were both using. But one day we vowed to get clean. It wasn’t easy. But we did it. Together. Then I got pregnant. We’ve both been clean ever since. We got married and had two beautiful daughters. Unfortunately our relationship started to go bad. We separated and I met my current boyfriend and I’m pregnant again. This time it’s a boy. I can say that I’m happy but with what I’ve endured, my moods change like the weather. Happy for now I guess. One thing I can say is that my children saved my life. Thank you for listening.
