I posted recently about my uBPD mom switching tactics and laying on the guilt hard to get me to break NC.

Since then she had called a bunch, messaged me tons of pictures of us because to her “things weren’t always bad”, tried calling my husband (something she knows would infuriate me that she surprisingly hasn’t tried before), keeps insisting she just wants to know one way or another if we will ever have a relationship and she will honor whatever I say (as if 1 1/2 of NC isn’t a clear answer). She said she’s been trying to respect me, that she hasn’t looked up my address even though it’s public record because she knows I have a house from a picture she saw on my private social media so now I have to find the FM. This felt like a vague threat to me and got my anxiety sparked. 

Now tonight I get an email saying “I don't need an answer from you because your Twitter account says it all. At least I have my answers now.” On my account I posted her texts/emails and wrote a thread on gaslighting and abuse. So part of me (the optimistic part) is like yay the trash took itself out!

The other part (the realistic part) is now worried about escalation. She’s already spiraling, letting me know she’s seeking out my private info, crossing boundaries she’s well aware of. I’m worried she may take it a step further and try to hurt me, my husband, our animals or my home. How often do they take it that far? Am I being insane or are my fears justifiable? Part of the reason I allow her messages to even get through to me is because I’m always monitoring for potential threat. I was hoping for a cease and desist to get something in writing, but I’m not sure if this will make her back down or escalate more. I doubt law enforcement will take me seriously so I just don’t know what steps to take to ensure me and my family are protected. Any suggestions?
